<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana">Introduction</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Before diving into writing plugins, I'm going
to spend this column giving your a brief overview of how NPDS is
constructed. This will help you if you decide to download the source
code and modify it or hack around in it.</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana">Modular Architecture</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">NPDS is based around nHTTPd 2.02 which is
both a server and an enviroment for turning Newton data into HTML.
nHTTPd itself does the grunt work of serving off the Newton while its
component plugins do the high-level stuff. So how does it all work?
Let's walk through installation, registration, activation, and access
of a data plugin, specifically, NoteServ.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Noteserv is an application but it allows
little user interaction beyond setting its preferences. When it's
installed onto a Newton with nHTTPd present, it registers itself with
the Plugin Registry and denotes itself as active or inactive. When
nHTTPd is opened, it sends an Activate() message to all plugins that
are listed as active in the registry. In response, the plugins
register their name, application symbol, virttual folder (/html/,
/dates/, etc) and a small completion script that accepts a
communications endpoint plus the current HTTP request and passes it
to the plugin app for processing. At the time nHTTPd is actually
Started, it sends another message to each registered plugin
"StartupScript()" that tells them that the server is going online.
This allows them to do any pre-processing they need to before
requests are accepted via HTTP.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Let's move now to what happens when a request
is received by nHTTPd: it parses the request and breaks it into a
frame with slots for the virtual folder, the requested filename, the
raw request, and any form data that's been submitted. This data is
passed, along with a reference to the current communications
endpoint, to the CompletionScript for the plugin that's registered to
handle requests for the given virtual folder. Inside the
CompletionScript, the request is submitted to the plugin application
and the results are output into the communications endpoint. So, you
can see that what we have is two servers for each transaction.. the
HTTP server and a data translation server.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">However, much of the work of translating can
actually be done by nHTTPd. When a file is created, for instance, the
current plugin requests that nHTTPd create an HTML template into
which the body of the file will be placed. Other functions, such as
the Hyperlinker and Percent-Escape translator are also handled by
nHTTPd. The CGI system is handled by nHTTPd as are all the server
side includes.</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana">Conclusion</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You'll learn more about the built-in
abilities of nHTTPd as we write the Calls plugin but for now, I
suggest that you learn NPDS Scripting as a precursor to more
heavy-duty programming that we'll embark upon next time.</FONT>
