<P><B>Path: </B>accessible via<FONT COLOR="#000099">

<P><B>Sample Output:</B> <A HREF="../example/dateserv.html" TARGET="_blank">DateServ
Default Page</A>

<P>DateServ makes items in your Dates database available over the WWW
in a number of formats. To do this, it reads directly from the Dates
soup, so any 3rd party applications that alter or extend the Dates
application may cause you problems. <I>However, there are no reports
of major conflict so forge ahead!</I>

<P><B>DateServ supports two modes of access:</B>

<OL>
   <LI>A direct path to your day's and week's agenda</LI>
   
   <LI>A forms-based query that returns any range of dates up to 31
   days in length.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The paths to the day and week view are, respectively,
<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">/dates/day.html </FONT>and
<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">/dates/week.html </FONT>The reason these items
are pre-specified is to allow DateServ to pre-cache them when NPDS
starts up. This minimizes time required for a request for these items
to be served.

<H4>Using Direct Path Access:</H4>

<P>Example: You want to link to your weekly agenda from a page in
your Notepad. You'd insert this HTML code<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">&lt;A HREF="/dates/week.html"&gt;</FONT>Weekly
Agenda<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">&lt;/A&gt;<BR>
</FONT>somewhere in that note.

<H3>A Special SSI Tag:</H3>

<P>Speaking of embedding things, you can also directly embed the
Daily Agenda (as a table) by using the
<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">&lt;AGENDA_DAY&gt;</FONT> Server Side Include
under Notepad Server. When the note containing this tag is served up,
a table containing the day's agenda will be inserted into the note's
HTML.

<H3>Configuring DateServ:</H3>

<OL>
   <LI><B>Week Length: </B>The week overview returned by DateServ is
   configurable. Open DateServ in the Extras Drawer and you'll see
   that you can select which day of the week is the "First" day of
   the week view and you can set the length of the week returned as
   well. I like to set it to a 6 day week starting on Monday so that
   my day off (Sunday) is hidden from view.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Event Classes:</B> Although <I>my</I> schedule is an open
   book, you may prefer NOT to show<I> Events, Meetings, or
   ToDo's.</I> You may select each class of Calendar entry for WWW
   display by tapping in the appropriate checkboxes. Note that
   turning off any Calendar event class <I>turns off ALL instances of
   that class.</I> There is <I>no support </I>for filtering by
   priority, folder, store, etc at present.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Meeting Length: </B>Since some people's meetings are
   indefinite in length, you may choose to NOT show the end time for
   meetings by de-selecting Show Duration under the Show Meetings
   checkbox.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Use Javascript: </B>You'll notice that when you click on a
   meeting or event, you get a nice little pop-up windoid with the
   pertinent information for that event. If, due to personal
   preference or security restrictions you do not wish to use this
   function, de-select this box.<BR>
   Clicking on links to your Datebook entries will then simply open
   new browser windows without use of Javascript.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Use Pre-Caching:</B> On a MP130 or a fast Newt with a lot
   of events, you may want to pre-create the day and week overview
   and store them in the cache after they are accessed so that they
   are accessible more readily. These files usually take up about 1
   and 4 K respectively and are removed when they expire (usually 30
   minutes to an hour).</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Active:</B> NPDS Plugins are dynamically
   loadable/unloadable. If you wish to turn on or off service of
   Dates data, open DateServ and de-check this box. To turn Dates
   back on, re-check it. You no longer need to freeze most NPDS
   plugins to de-activate them.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>FAQ for DateServ:</H3>

<P>Q: I just added a meeting to this week's schedule and it hasn't
shown up yet. Why?

<P>A: The daily and weekly overview are cached files. Your new event
will show up in an hour or so after the cached version of day.html or
week.html has expired.

<P>Q: How can I prevent access to my Dates data from outside my
intranet, LAN, etc?

<P>A: At present you cannot. However, though NPDS 2.0 has barely
shipped, the next version of NPDS will support basic password
protection and IP range restriction for enhanced security of you
sensitive data.

<P>Q: Can I post to the Datebok from the Web?

<P>A: Not yet. I decided to wait for better security before
implementing this feature in a publicly available package. MY Newton
allows posting via the web ;-)

<P>Q: Can I change the format of DateServ's output?

<P>A: No, but if you're enterprising you can hack the source any way
you want. The HTML templates and constructor scripts are well
delimited and fairly modular.

<P>Q: Do you have any support for MoreInfo?

<P>A: No. I can't do it without reverse engineering the MoreInfo
software which is not legal. Silverware is welcome to add support to
the DateServ source for its product.
