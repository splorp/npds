<H1>History of NPDS</H1>

<P>NPDS originally started out as the demo application nHTTPd and was
authored as an article in the <A HREF="http://www.mactech.com/" TARGET="_blank">March
1997</A> <FONT COLOR="#990000"><I>develop</I></FONT> magazine by Ray
Rischpater*. nHTTPd was very limited but when I read the article I
saw great potential for it so I began to code and experiment.

<P>Quite soon (early July) I had a version of nHTTPd and one plugin
(Notepad Server) that could serve simple Notes as web pages and that
software was released to the delight of many Newton users.

<P>Next came NPDS 1.51, a beefed up version of Notepad Server that
began to hint at things to come.. Dates service, posting Notes from
the Web, etc. <A HREF="http://www.pencomputing.com/" TARGET="_blank">Pen
Computing</A> wrote a small blurb about NPDS 1.51.

<P>After many cycles of development and the contributions of many
testers and users, NPDS 2.0 has emerged as the definitive handheld
web server featured in a short piece in the March 1999 issue of
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/" TARGET="_blank">WiReD</A> magazine (p
150). We have certainly come a long way..

nHTTPd. He's bound by some Intellectual Property claims from doing
so. I, on the other hand, will be glad to talk with you all you
wish.</I></FONT>
