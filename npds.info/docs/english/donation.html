<H1>Support Future NPDS Development</H1>

<P>NPDS Is <B>freeware</B> and is released under terms of the Gnu
Public License. It has been a real pleasure to develop, implement,
and release it to the Newton community.

<P>However, the fact that it's free doesn't prevent me from asking
that if you have enjoyed or used Newton Personal Data Sharing, please
consider a small donation to help me in my development efforts. I am
sorely lacking in hardware and networking equipment and could easily
address these deficits with donations from only a small portion of my
users. If you can find a few bucks, I'd really appreciate it :-)

<P><I>Donations to NPDS Development are not tax-deductable.</I>

<P>NPDS has no protection or disabling scheme. It is fully functional
regardless of whether you register and you are completely welcomed
and encouraged to use it even if you choose not to Register.

<P>So,<B> </B>What kinda dough am I asking? I have settled on
<B>Basic</B> and <B>Super-Generous</B> Tiers as follows:

<P><A NAME=Basic></A><B>Basic Thank-You:</B>

<P>Persons donating the $7.00 minimum for a single-user "license"
will recieve an electronic copy of the <U>NPDS Cookbook</U>, an
unofficial guide to unlocking the hidden potential of NPDS. In the
Cookbook, I cover such topics as NPDS Scripts, useful NPDS API
functions, novel uses of NPDS, and so on. <U>NPDS Cookbook</U> also
contains the <I>fully annotated</I> source to Newton Personal Data
Sharing to allow some major hacking..

<P><A NAME=Super></A><B>Super-Generous Thank-You:</B>

<P>Those donating $15.00 (by ordering the Manual and Disks) will
recieve a printed copy of the <U>NPDS Manual</U> and the <U>NPDS
Cookbook </U>as well as all NPDS Components on a floppy disk.

<P><B>Macintosh Users:</B>
