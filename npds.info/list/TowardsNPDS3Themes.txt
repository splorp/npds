Subject: [NPDS] Towards NPDS 3: themes and structure


Hi all,

Just a thought I had under the shower (why would I take showers if I 
hadn't crazy thoughts there?).

NPDS 3 will not simply be a new kernel. It should be a real 
improvement of NPDS, more personal and easier to use.

It could come with a set of themes (css, templates) of personal data server
i.e. new user would just have to install the various packages, do a 
quick setup of the server (port, admin password, name & other tracker 
client information), choose a theme and the Newton will automatically 
serve pages according to this theme. Of course, it has to be 
gorgious, follow W3C standards and readable with Newtscape/NetHopper.

A theme would be a set of css, template files & pictures giving a 
style to the server. For example I thought there could be one making 
the server look like a Newton (with the NotePad decoration and so on).

In fact, there would be integrated a theme prefs where you would 
choose between package-themes coming with NPDS (or from third 
parties), and personal theme, directly from NotePad/binary servers, 
thus allowing full customization of all that.

What do you think?

and

If you think it's a good idea, are there any volunteering & talented 
webdesigners wishing to make some static pseudo-NPDS server following 
a given theme?

Also, I think we should discuss about the structure of NPDS-3 
servers. There are things we should keep as is, I think, and things 
that should change or be replaced.

I guess that we need:
* some functionality like the pager (the pager has to be entirely 
redesigned, for example it should store pages in a soup and open 
itself automatically after a restart if it wasn't closed)
Maybe the pager soup could simply be In/OutBox?
* some functionality to simply serve pages (from the 
NotePad/NewtWorks), with inline graphics (so you can serve very 
simply a note)
* the dates and cardfile servers (probably need some little changes 
and they should benefit from new techs such as HTTP authentication)
* some way to serve screen shots
* the tracker client of course

The big thing I would like to discuss with you is the Note-posting 
capability and forum-like (or guest-book like) feature. I have 
several ideas, but maybe I should listen from your suggestions first.

Paul

Crazy thoughts? Not likely. You must have some spare time coming up, 
Paul. Your Newton-based activity level has popped up again.

Yes. Oh, yes.

I am liking where this is heading. Online weblogging and self-publishing 
products like Blogger, Movable Type, and Radio Userland work this way. 
All of them have the capability of using predesigned themes or custom 
user-defined ones, which can be selected on the fly. Radio Userland, in 
fact, also operates as a local HTTP server as well, so you can see 
exactly what you're going to get once the site is published.

Creating a set of page templates (perhaps identifying and separating out 
common page elements such as headers, footers, navigation bars, copyright 
notices, etc. into individual include files), style sheets, and 
associated graphic files would be a fairly easy task. Making sure that 
they validate in terms of W3C HTML (or XHTML) and CSS, would be a given.

I would be willing to create several base templates and themes for the 
project. First of all, I would need to document all of the various types 
of templates required (error pages vs. content display pages; CardServ 
vs. NoteServ pages; posting forms, confirmation notices, etc.) I don't 
suppose that there is any documentation of what pages currently get 
generated by NPDS is there? Of course, if we're redeveloping the entire 
base of NPDS services and functions, then the page and template list will 
be different.

Paul, is there going to be any issue with NPDS 3.0 serving up multiple 
files from the soup for a given page? Potentially, there could be a dozen 
or two file associated with any given theme-based page served up. Just 
wondering.

Hello. Let me introduce myself... :)

I don't use the pager very much, but I suppose I would if some changes 
were made. That being said, I'd like to see a larger Newton-side 
interface for one. Again, I like the idea of using the In/Out box as the 
interface to the pager soup. It just seems that many of the NPDS 
components maintain their own way of handling files and content. The more 
of these that can be combined into the common system wide interfaces such 
as Notes or In/Out, the better.

>* some functionality to simply serve pages (from the

>simply a note)

Is there any way we can improve the way NPDS distinguishes between a 
plain text (or lightly styled, like bolded or sized text...) note from 
one that contains pure HTML content? Specifically, I guess I'm interested 
to see how intelligent NPDS can be in terms of parsing the content of a 
note and how it wraps that content in a template. Does this make sense?

>* the dates and cardfile servers (probably need some little changes 
>and they should benefit from new techs such as HTTP authentication)

Authentication would be useful for allowing the admin to control server 
functions or plug-in prefs. I like the idea of a web-based remote admin 
system for all components of the server.

>* some way to serve screen shots

No argument here. How about live-streaming animated gifs? :)

>The big thing I would like to discuss with you is the Note-posting 
>capability and forum-like (or guest-book like) feature. I have

I would be interested specifically in different ways of displaying the 
posted notes. Sort order, with time stamping, number of posts listed 
using the SSI tag, etc. Being able to thread a series of posts, or at 
having a reply to a post directly linked to the original somehow would be 
useful.

Here's a couple other things to consider:

* server logging and reporting
* integration of NPDS Watcher
* web-based binary file uploading
* Notes folder browser

Whew.

Once again, Grant, I have to take the dictionary to learn a new 
expression you're using. Except that this time, I did not find 
anything into any of my dicts. What do you mean "[It] would be a 
given."? Maybe something is missing there?

(BTW, I quite enjoy having to learn new expressions).

I thought that we could work together on this. I mean, we could all 
say what kind of interface we want from the features (hence my list 
that you completed & commented).

Why are you talking about files?
And what kind of problems could there be?

I guess you mean something like: "is it possible to make several soup 
requests to send a single resource over HTTP?" the answer is it is 
technically what NPDS already does in some cases (for example when it 
displays the list of notes, it makes a query on the Note soup and 
then iterates on the results to display the list).

>Hello. Let me introduce myself... :)

Do you have some kind of reference? ;)
I think that there are other web designer professional with a NPDS 
server and talented amateurs. I am probably the worst HTML coder on 
this list, that's why I'm looking for talents ;)

The In/Out idea was actually Nicolas Zinovieff's.

>Is there any way we can improve the way NPDS distinguishes between a

Of course. This should be linked with a clear 
Notes-serving/HTML-serving/Templates/Admin-notes-editing/Bulletin-board 
policy.
It is currently quite a mess, so ideas are welcome. Especially 
something allowing us to distinguish between a post and a note from 
the NotePad interface (maybe using the routing button or something, 
ideas are welcome and encouraged).

>Specifically, I guess I'm interested
>to see how intelligent NPDS can be in terms of parsing the content of a

It fits what I've been thinking about. I don't have any clear 
solution yet, but there is work to be done for sure.

>Authentication would be useful for allowing the admin to control server

Sounds great, doesn't it?

BTW, I can see two not-too-boring ways to communicate dreams of a 
software. Designing mockups (such as pseudo-static NPDS websites I 
was talking about) and drafting documentation. Both are easy to use 
for the coding process. Of course, we can also draft specifications 
if you prefer it the more-official way.

Let's put it at the bottom of the list after Victor's idea of a RGB & 
HSV sliders ;)

>I would be interested specifically in different ways of displaying the

BTW, about SSIs (and it's linked to your request). One of the great 
weaknesses of SSIs I guess is the fact that they can't take 
arguments. No-one uses the "unused" argument in their scripts, don't 
you?
(I also thought of inline NewtonScript directly in page for server-side code).

>Being able to thread a series of posts, or at

It's what I call Bulletin Board-feature. I think that we all see the 
Notes-posting capability this way, don't we?

>* server logging and reporting

Oh yeah, I forgot this part. One of the thing that isn't reliable on 
the current hacked version, and that will be very easy to add with 
the new kernel.

>* integration of NPDS Watcher

FTP server?

Just like showing index? Nice idea.

Sorry about that. I keep forgetting that I need to try to write without 
using as many English mannerisms as I usually do. "[It] would be a 
given." basically means that it "would be assumed" that this is the way 
we would do it. In other words, I would assume that we would make all of 
the HTML and CSS valid according to the W3C standards.

Yes, this is what I meant. I guess I shouldn't have used the term 
"files", but instead the term "requests". I was concerned whether or not 
NPDS could actually serve a single web page that consisted of several 
(and possibly dozens) or separate images and other bits from the soup.

Sorry, no reference. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knew that I

Oh, I'm sure a few people would pop out of the woodwork. Perhaps Andreas 
Linkvist could help out in this manner.

Good. We're thinking about the same thing.

In regards to "pseudo-static NPDS websites", do you mean building mockup 
pages and serving them on an NPDS server? Or just on any server so they 
approximately what we would like the future of NPDS to be?

Lovely.

Well, I am going to assume that the new NPDS will be more stable and 
robust than the current version. This would make it less necessary to 
have something like NPDS Watcher monitoring the process and restarting 
the Newton when thing go wrong. However, if such a monitor is deemed to 
be a requirement, why can't we build some sort of auto-restart mechanism 
into the NPDS package itself? I'm just asking a question. There may be 
several reason why this is a dumb idea.

I suppose that would be the most logical way of looking at it. Being able 
to upload a binary file (sound, package, image, whatever...) using an 
authenticated web interface would be useful.

That's what I was thinking.

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Towards NPDS 3: themes and structure
From: John Skinner <john@johnskinner.net>


I like the all comments so far and would like to add a few to the
discussion. (sorry if it's long, I got carried away)

Yes I agree on: File uploading/downloading, Bulletin Board style threaded
note posting/reading.

And these...

--

(1.) LAYOUT: I really like the idea of having some sort of Page templates or
themes.

We could have reference to the different "Themes" in the documentation
(pdf?) with little pictures so one could see/predict the layout (without;
having to change it, browse to it from an external browser and look, and
back and forth).

It seems it would make more sense to have them be CSS so they would be
incorporated into every page that is viewed from the NPDS server. Like on
Grant's page with his navigation bar at the top, or Paul's NPDS server now,
he has the Newton logo .gif file as a background on (I think) every page. It
doesn't have to be CSS, but some similar principle. This would help to give
continuity to the site if it were on every page.

It would be nice to have it done in frames, but then we would be excluding
browsing to it from Newton browsers like NetHopper/Newt's Cape wouldn't we?

If we used frames, we could have it load like a navigation bar into one
frame on first load, then only load following pages in the main window.
Maybe this could be done somehow with CSS though, I don't know. Thoughts?

NOTE: I'm a novice web designer, but I would be willing to make a couple of
simple "Themes"!

--

(2.) WEBPAGER: I also agree on storing the received pages into somewhere
like the In/Out store.

I also agree with Grant that the interface should be bigger. Maybe full
screen even.

I know that in a older version number of the WebPager, you could reply
directly to a page (from someone that sent it from a Newton running NPDS) by
tapping on the little button that looks like a Newton. The only awkward part
of this was that it had to open NetHopper and download the senders
"WebPager" page from their NPDS server.

I know it seems like a lot, but it would be nice if it could operate similar
to AOL's Instant Messenger or other chat program. Instead of loading the
web page of the sender's "WebPager" in a browser, maybe the reply could be
composed in a new, different frame of the WebPager window. Then it could be
sent directly to the sender's WebPager program. Thoughts?

--

(3.) REMOTE ADMIN: (To re-enable) The ability to post to any directory, not
just the default "Whiteboard" area.

Right now you can remotely shutdown the NPDS server. It would be nice if you
could also reboot your Newton remotely. Maybe by somehow triggering some
NewtScript to have NPDS Watcher to do it.


(4.) REBOOTING: I think all of us would like to have the option to have all
of NPDS start minimized in the "Star" menu upon reboot.

(Speaking of this; Hey Grant, let me know if you ever get that "CardCloser"
to work on Newton OS 2.x)

Reading what Grant said about having a web-based remote admin system: THIS
IS A LONG SHOT, but it might be possible with a modified Steve Weyer's
NewtVNC! Right now, the two things stopping us are: In the current version
there is no JAVA web-based connection to the server like in the real VNC,
and the server mode only listens for a connection for a handful of seconds.
We could ask Steve if it would be possible to put the JAVA web interface in

Probably. But a new interface would definitely make easy to implement

Indeed, we need a watcher, especially considering that other things 
could bring the server down. I am not sure it has to be specifically 
included into the server, although it's not really a module but 
rather a function.

Actually, I'm not very fond of frames as they're (a) not supported by 
many browsers including NetHopper/Newt's Cape and (b) apparently 
dropped with HTML 4.0.

This and many other things can be done with CSS.
I'm just an amateur HTML coder and more interested in the languages 
than the visual aspects of things, but as I see it, CSS is a way to 
have the thing look nice under modern browsers (supporting CSS, 
basically) and keep the thing readable in Lynx/NetHopper/Newt's Cape 
& Co.

So should be the script editor (it's a pain when you try to write

You can still do it. What it opens depends on which browser are 
installed, but I agree that there should be an included way to answer 
as you describe it.

You want to trigger VNC from NPDS? (there is no need for any line of

Excellent. This makes the develop of themes extremely flexible. Not that 
I would encourage overdoing the design of a theme just for the sake of 
the design. We will still need to consider the file size of the various 
components that make up a theme. The less bloated we get, the better.

Erm. Yes. I am. I guess I was being a bit too indirect. In fact it was a 
reference to my ability to create web -based designs. Sign me up!

I understand now. This method certainly makes it easier to prototype 
ideas.

Let me see if I understand this. We would be getting rid of the concept 
of the script editor to create custom SSI tags, by replacing it with the 
ability to have NPDS parse and execute the NS code directly from the HTML 
(or noteserved pages). Is this correct?

Now I've got it. I guess I was just curious to see if their were any 
benefits or efficiencies to combined the Watcher with another component 
of NPDS.

I'll try to explain better Paul.

JAVA...      The regular VNC software that you get for Windows, Mac, 
Linux and other OSs has a JAVA web browser interface incorporated into 
it, allowing one to access the VNC server from a standard JAVA enabled 
web browser. Otherwise, the only way to connect to a VNC server is by 
downloading and installing a OS specific VNC client on your computer. 
Right now, the only way to connect to NewtVNC is by using standard VNC 
client software.
In order for NewtVNC to be able to accept incomming connections from a 
WEB BROWSER instead of a VNC client, there would have to be the JAVA 
based web browser interface added to NewtVNC.

Triggering......         The current NewtVNC has a "listen" button to 
start to listen for incomming connections, but it times-out after about 
15 seconds. So, you can't have your NewtVNC in server mode all day 
waiting for connections. I thought that maybe we could incorporate a 
link into a web page served by NPDS, that could somehow make the NewtVNC 
program start to listenfor a connection. Then, when you try to connect 
to it right after clicking this link, you would be within the timeout 
period and be able to connect.

Do any of these ramblings make it more clear, or did I just complicate it?

I've been following this thread closely but haven't had time to reply. 
However, I saw something that made me cringe and had to put in mi dos 
centavos.

I considered and rejected inline newtonscript at one point since not too 
many users of NPDS could write Newtonscript, and in fact, I even had a 
rough extension to Notepad Server that could run arbitrary Newtonscript 
posted from the web, so it can be done. I was considering using it as some 
sort of remote administration  tool. Anyway, if you implement inline 
execution, you need a tight security policy with this. Otherwise, I could 
post a note containing RATHER malicious Newtonscript and your Newton could 
be rendered nearly unusable. The big problem is that everything runs with 
full read-write-execute permissions in the Newtonscript environment. You 
need to be REALLY sure that nothing can slip in from outside to sabotage 
your machine.

All this said, I think it's a great idea, provided it's properly 
implemented. Another thing is that passing variables to server side 
includes CAN be done. I simply was too lazy to write the parser that would 
take the SSI tag, parse out the variable(s), and pass them to the script. 
However, it can be done. The unused variable that's in every NPDS SSI 
function declaration is required by the onboard NS compiler (for some 
arcane reason), but it doesn't have to be unused, it just has to be in the 
function declaration, Actually, if I remember correctly, you can even have 
more than one variable in that declaration, but there has to be at least 
one.

Also, the SSI code can be modified so that it functions outside a page, 
acting more like a CGI. If I remember right, there's a tag in the SSI soup 
for the "name" of the SSI. If someone had time, he could write a wrapper 
that would be able to call the SSI function as an executable, knowing the 
name of the SSI. Thus, you could do things like http://my.npds.com/cgi-bin/
MySpecialScript and return a full dynamically generated page.

I also agree with Paul's assertion that the interface for Script Editor 
needs to be revised. It fits nicely on my old MP130 but not on your fancy 
MP2x00 screens.

Oh man, you guys are making me hanker to get out my old Newt and start 
coding for it again (now that I have a job and a degree)

Cheers,

Matt

	I'll chime in here -- despite the beauty of the Watcher
(..beholder?), it still seems to defeat my server, and as soon as I leave,
something crashes it, and it often restarts without establishing a
connection.  So there it sits, thinking it is connected, and since there are
no queries, it never resets again, and I find it the next time I am in the
office in this unconnected, but ever-so-ready to serve state.

	My work-around is a simple Stop-Start cycle (which also sometimes
requires a "Connect" tap), which I would love to be able to do automatically
from within Watcher or whatever it evolves to.

I certainly understand John's point about making the web pages refresh or 
change faster by minimizing the amount of content reloading by using 
frames. However, this kind of efficiency offered by frames is rather 
misplaced. Since you are actually loading more HTML with a frames based 
interface than than single page design, you end up sending more data to 
the client at any given time. For a design the has a navbar, main content 
area, and perhaps a footer - the client actually has to request four html 
pages including the frameset wrapper in order to display the page. Oof!

To Paul's point, as far as I can determine, the W3C has not dropped 
frames as part of either the current HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 
recommendations.

Is there anything we could do using server push from NPDS (or the pager 
component) back to the desktop browser to refresh the web page with the 
response? Maybe this is too complex for discussion right now.

Matt, if you're serious about getting back into the game, I'd be willing 
to send you one of my extra "lightly-used and previously loved..." 
MP2100s for you to mess around with. Free. Gratis. No money down. Let me

I see. This is rather part of VNC than NPDS.

This can be done with a simple SSI with NPDS 2.x.

Of course, inline NewtonScript is subject to a clear definition of 
what is a posted note and what is not.

I can't see where, but I trust you.

It is currently some NPDS-core frame that is passed as the argument.

Actually, I deduced this from the division in three DTDs, strict,

statement of the W3C saying that they consider frames obsoletes.

Actually, this can only be done by not closing the connection, and 
only with browsers supporting it. Or with some Java applet.
