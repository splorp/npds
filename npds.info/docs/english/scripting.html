<H2><IMG SRC="../images/shots/EditorIcon.gif" WIDTH=74 HEIGHT=102 ALIGN=left><A NAME=Intro></A>Introduction</H2>

<P>During development of NPDS 2.0, I recieved a constant stream of
requests for custom <A HREF="advanced.html#SSI">Server Side
Includes</A>. However, since every SSI added means additional parsing
time, I couldn't very well add in lots of neat (but often of dubious
usefulness) items like temperature, Longitude &amp; Latitude, owner's
Birthday, and so on, since not everyone would use them.

<P>My answer to providing custom SSI is the <I>NPDS Simple Scripting
Architecture</I>.

<P>I've added the ability to link text-based scripts to user-defined
HTML extensions. These scripts can return text values (most common)
and/or can execute actions on the host machine. All that is required
is a minimum of Newtonscript knowledge and the ability to follow the
example scripts packaged with <B>Script Editor.</B>

<H2><IMG SRC="../images/shots/editor.gif" WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=324 ALIGN=right><A NAME=Editor></A>Script
Editor</H2>

<P>On the right is a screenshot of your interface to NPDS Scripting,
the Script Editor. The UI elements are as follows:

<UL>
   <LI><B>Script Info:</B> Tapping in the light gray box will opena
   slip where you can define script name, its SSI, and whether the
   script is active</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Script Length: </B>A visual cue to show you how close to
   the limit of <I>4096 bytes</I> your script text is.</LI>

   <LI><B>Evaluate: </B>Invokes the actual compiler in nHTTPd and

</UL>

<H2><A NAME=Writing></A>Writing Scripts</H2>

<P>A NPDS Script is cast as a standard Newtonscript function that
returns some value. Since most of what NPDS is used for is
text-based, most NPDS Scripts should return Text. In this example,
we're going to retrieve the version of NewtonOS in use on this
Newton.

<P>1. Open Script Editor and tap the "New Script" Button.

<P>2. Enter the Following Text (<I>Note that some of it is already
written for you on the Notepad</I>)

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>func(</CODE></FONT><FONT COLOR="#990000"><CODE>nullvar</CODE></FONT><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>)</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>begin</CODE></FONT>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>local
      </CODE></FONT><CODE>theOutput</CODE><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>:=
      </CODE></FONT><CODE>"NewtonOS ROM
      Version:"</CODE><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE> &amp;&amp;
      Gestalt(0x1000003).ROMversionstring;</CODE></FONT>
      
      <P><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>return
      </CODE></FONT><CODE>theOutput</CODE><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>;</CODE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT COLOR="#006600"><CODE>end</CODE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>3. Tap on the "Script Info" Box and enter a Name and SSI for this
script. If you wish it to be available to NPDS right away, tap the
"Script Is Active" checkbox. You may activate and inactivate scripts
at will simply by changing the value of this checkbox. For purpose of
explaining how to use this script, I am going to assume you gave it
the SSI value "VERSION".

<P>4. Let's try this function out. Tap the "<B>Evaluate</B>" button.
You'll get a window that should give you either the text output of
your function (or a cryptic error message and the Newtonscript Error
Code).

<P>5. To use this function in your WWW content, place the "HTML" code
&lt;VERSION&gt; wherever you wish to return the value of this script.
When that page is served, you'll see that the text that was returned
when you evaluated the script is subsituted in place of the
&lt;VERSION&gt; tag. To turn off this script, open it under the
script editor, tap the information line, and un-check the "Script is
Active" box.

<H3>Your Example Worked. What Do I Need to Know to Write My Own
SSI?</H3>

<P><B>Dummy Variable</B>

<P>Look at the head of the script: "<I>func(nullvar)</I>". The
<B>nullvar</B> is a dummy variable that is required by NPDS's
Compiler. You can change its name, but the fact remains that a NPDS
Script must accept <B>ONE and ONLY ONE</B> argument. You cannot pass
your own arguments to your script. (There is a way around this that
I'll mention later)

<P><B>Script Length</B>

<P>There is a limit on the length of NPDS Scripts to encourage you to
write FAST and efficient code and currently that limit is 4096 Bytes.

<P><B>Compiler Variables</B>

<P>4096 Bytes isn't a lot, especially in light of the fact that in
order to command, for instance, nHTTPd, you usually need lengthy code
like

<P><CODE>GetRoot().|nHTPd:ALLPEN|</CODE>

<P>In anticipation of this, and also to save some typing, the NPDS
Compiler supports symbols that stand for specific expressions.

<H4>CGI Environment Variables</H4>

<P>If you've ever programmed in Perl, you'll recognize the names of
these variables. These are the standard names for specific values
that pertain to HTTP transactions on your server. To use these, place
them in your script in the same context as you would a string. For
instance, if you wanted to create a fully qualified URL to your
server's DateServ, you could use the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT
variables like so: 

<P><FONT COLOR="#003399"><CODE>"http://SERVER_NAME:SERVER_PORT/dates"</CODE></FONT>

<P>Notice that the variables aren't treated in any special manner.
They will be substituted in at script-compile time with appropriate
values.

<H4>Script Execution Time</H4>

<P>When you Evaluate a script, also present in the results window
will be a count of Ticks required for compiling and execution of your
code. Script Editor will complain if your code takes longer than 360
Ticks (6 Seconds) to Execute.

<P>While there is no limit on the size of function you create, keep
in mind that when a NPDS Script is invoked, it is parsed, compiled,
and evaluated on the fly during service of the page that invokes it.
A script that takes 360 Ticks to run will add 6 seconds to the 1-4
seconds its takes NPDS to serve a page for a total of up to 10
seconds. Many browsers will time out at 10 seconds and close their
connections. Hence the suggestion of keeping your scripts short and
sweet...

<P>If you want real POWER, learn the NPDS API and write your own
custom plugins. With my user proto and documentation you can create a
simple NPDS plugin in an afternoon, with the limiting step being your
ability to write your own data generation functions.

<P><B>Limit on Output Size</B>

<P>There is no longer a limit on output size. You're limited only by
the free heap on your Newton. I'd suggest not generating more than
about 2000 bytes, though.&nbsp;

<H2><A NAME=FAQ></A>FAQ</H2>

<P>Q: How many Scripts should I keep active at a given time?

<P>A: Well, when a script is "Active", NPDS output is scanned for the
presence of the SSI assigned to that scripts. This takes a couple of
ticks per SSI. Not until an instance of the SSI is found is the
script actually evaluated. However, since we're trying to keep things
fast, I'd suggest no more than 10-12 User scripts active at any given
time.

<P>Q: How do I access the name of the file being requested?

<P>A: During HTTP Request, nHTTPd fills a slot in its base frame
called <B><CODE>CURRENT_HTTP_REQUEST </CODE></B>with the following
data frame:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>{ip: user's IP address (string),</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>path: the directory and filename requested
   (string),</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>time: HTTP formatted time of the request,</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>request: the path and filename of the request,</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>dns: the DNS value of the user's IP (if defined),</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>agent: the browser the client is using}</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To access these items, use the following code:

<P><B><CODE>|NPDS|.CURRENT_HTTP_REQUEST.</CODE><I><CODE>slot</CODE></I></B>

<P>Q: What is that "Script Returns a Static Value" option?

<P>A: NPDS keeps its speed despite the additional features I keep
adding by doing a lot of pre-processing and cacheing. Some of NPDS'
own SSI are evaluated at Startup and are held in memory throughout
the lifetime of the session.

<P>This option within the Scripting Architecture will be similar in
function, but is not yet implemented. If you have scripts that will
return a static value (say, the Latitude and Longitude of your City),
you can check this option and when support for pre-evaluation is
included in NPDS, your scripts will run much faster since they can be
pre-compiled and evaluated when the server starts up.

<P>Q: I hit <B>Evaluate </B>and get an exception.. I am sure my code
is OK. and all I did was try to do something using NPDS..

<P>A: It's good policy to keep nHTTPd open (but minimized) when
you're writing scripts. You'll get better results without having to
do some sneaky stuff to fool the system into thinking its open. See
if this helps..

<P>Q: Can I use these scripts as real CGIs (Programs that can be
accessed directly by a HTTP request)?

<P>A: Not yet. Some issues remain with getting this up and going in
an easy to use and secure manner. But it's a definite goal. For now,
you can define a pretty complicated SSI tag and use it as the total
content of a note. Remember that you can generate a pretty large and
complex chunk of text from one of these SSIs.
