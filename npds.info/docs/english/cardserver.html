<P><B>Path:</B> accessible via

Search Result</A>

<P>CardServ allows users to search the Names (Cardfile) database,
receive a ranked list of entries matching your search terms, then
view any of those entries in one of two ways:

<UL>
   <LI>As a formatted HTML Page</LI>
   
   <LI>As a <A HREF="http://imc.org/pdi/" TARGET="_blank">Versit
   vCard</A> for import into a vCard-capable Address Book such as
   that which ships with Netscape Communicator 3.x and higher.</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can access CardServ via the inserting the URL path
<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">/cards/index.html </FONT>or by embedding its
SSI<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">, </FONT> or you can have the actual search
form embedded in a note by using the SSI tag
<FONT COLOR="#3333CC">&lt;NAME_SEARCH&gt;.</FONT>

<H3>Configuring CardServ</H3>

<P><B>Show Notes: </B>Since many of us store provate information in
the Notes of our Name cards, un-check the "<I>Show Notes</I>" box to
keep this information hidden. It is set to <B>TRUE </B>by default
until you change it the first time.

<P><B>Active:</B> NPDS Plugins are dynamically loadable/unloadable.
If you wish to turn on or off service of Names data, open CardServ
and de-check this box. To turn Names back on, re-check it. You no
longer need to freeze most NPDS plugins to de-activate them.

<H3>FAQ for CardServ</H3>

<P>Q: I don't use Netscape Communicator. How can I utilize the
wonderful vCard standard?

<P>A: Well, some programs support importing of vCard data from a text
file. You may choose to download a person's vCard to disk then import
it manually. Other than that, I don't know. I wrote CardServ for my
own use.

<P>Q: Can I use CardServ as a sync tool with a Pilot or my desktop
computer?

<P>A: In its current state, no. Future development may head that way
here in Lightyear Land or someone may decide to implement it on their
own. One-way transmission of massive amounts Cards data is more
likely to come soon than two-way syncing. For example, early
experiemental builds of CardServ had an LDAP server built in as the
query system for the Card file which supported transfer of the whole
Cardfile as an LDAP database.

<P>Q: How can I prevent access to my Names data from outside my
intranet, LAN, etc?

<P>A: At present you cannot. However, though NPDS 2.0 has barely
shipped, the next version of NPDS will support basic password
protection and IP range restriction for enhanced security of you
sensitive data.

<P>Q: Can I post to the Cardfile from the Web?

<P>A: Not yet. I decided to wait for better security before
implementing this feature in a publicly available package. MY Newton
allows posting via the web ;-) so it's on it's way.
