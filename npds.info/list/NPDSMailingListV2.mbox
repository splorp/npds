From: Grant [Shorts In January] Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

A couple of months ago, John Clark was looking for the newest version of 
the GIF Server package. Was this ever posted to the NPDS download server? 
If not, could someone send me a copy of via email? I have just updated 
all the other components of the suite, and would like to get the GIF 
Server up and running as well. I took a peek through all the packages, 
but the revised GIF Server was not among them.

Matt, I don't know if you're on this list, but you might want to check 
into the following. The homepage.mac.com server still has an old copy of 
your site prior to your renaming (and apparently dated from around August 
2000) at:

     http://homepage.mac.com/lightyearmedia/

Just to avoid confusing people (like me - for a few minutes anyway...), 
maybe it could be redirected to the current site:

     http://homepage.mac.com/lightyeardesign/

Thanks.

Grant

I don't remember if Paul's C++ GIF Server was ever released for wide
distribution: it's not perfectly stable, whereas the old one is.  It does
do 16-greyscale GIFs though.  I have a copy, and I know some other NPDS
testers have it.

That's the main reason I wanted to test it - greyscale.

I'm working on a way to automate the capture and serving of a series of 
screen dumps for documenting specific Newton processes and software use. 
Greyscale would make the end result much more pleasurable. If you could 
be so kind as to borrow me a copy, I will do my darndest to find a few 
bugs... :)

Thanks.

I don't seem to have a copy kicking around on my PeeCee anymore.  I'll try
and find some time to export it off of my Newton, but in the meantime Paul
might get you a copy faster than I can.

Before my Newton was stolen, I ran it nearly every day with Paul's
greyscale Gif Server.  He mailed it to me when I asked.  People would hit
the screen over and over some days, and I really didn't have much trouble
with it, except when I first started running it.  I think I trashed the
cache and all the prefs, reinstalled the GIF Server, and that solved the
problem.  No problems afterwards.

Grant, it's in the mail (on a separate message), if you haven't already
received a copy from Paul.  Test away!

I should be receiving a Newton 2000 in the mail shortly; unfortunately
I've changed jobs and am quite mobile nowadays.  My original Newton is in
the evidence locker until after the trial, in February, so maybe it'll be
back online someday in the future.

AFAIK, Matt didn't post it to his website.
BTW, Matt is not on this list.

Please note that the current version is a debug version. I don't know 
about the possible problems it brings as the NPDS core is full of 
bugs.

Alright, I understand I don't have to mail it to you.

I wish I could receive my Newtons in the mail shortly. :-(

I haven't run across anything so far today. It's stable, and wicked fast! 
Thanks for the information everyone.

>I wish I could receive my Newtons in the mail shortly. :-(

We're all pulling for you too, Paul. I can't imagine being Newtonless for 
so long.

Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2001 13:33:34 -0500

Hello -

I often find that I cannot register with a tracker - even while other people
appear as registered (and are in fact online). 
The registration goes as expected (connect/disconnect floaters appear),  but
-- my server does not appear in the tracker's listing.  (Yes, I reload the
page) Even a full reset, manual regup and setting pre-programmed regup times
does not seem to work. I simply wait a few days, the behaviour disappears,
and I am again able to register and appear on a tracker.

I am behind a firewall, but I know I can be seen, because people who know my
permanent IP address still visit my site when it is not tracked.

This behaviour makes me think it is a problem with the tracker, and not my
client.

Any comments/suggestions?

Paul F.

Does this happen with both Matt's RealBASIC tracker
(http://130.126.50.66/) and my Java tracker (http://131.104.48.34:2110)?

Hey Victor -

I tried altering my settings to register on your tracker, but I can't even
get your page to load any more (endless 403s), so I have a null result up to
now.  I'm not exactly sure I have all the settings right in the Tracker
Client to reg w/ you.

Bah, the server was down for some reason.  I don't think it crashed, but
who knows.  It was stable for a loooong time.  Try again now.

No such luck...  Got your server page to load once, did the regup on my

It is indeed a problem of Matt's tracker. And the admin.cgi doesn't 
work, so I cannot restart it. The only thing to do is to tell Matt 
about it.

Victor's server is currently running properly as I've been able to

The server is going good.  Your (Paul F's) tracker is registered, and I
can access the page fine with both eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca and 131.104.48.34
from on campus and from home on my cable modem (which routes through
Chicago, even though I'm a 10 minute drive from the server).  It could be
some network problem - Ontario Universities' outside connection (one of
them) is provided by Bell Nexxia, not the best bandwidth provider out
there.

Thanks Victor - I should have mentioned that I did see my server listed on
your tracker... I know we are somewhat disconnected from MAE-EAST at the
moment, so that may be part of it as well.

I believe that was a feature that Paul wrote... you can refer to Notes by
their (URI-encoded) titles.

Indeed.
What's in the log is the accessed URL. There is a link to this page 
(about Newton User Groups) in the FAQ, and I used the name of the 
note so that if you move it to another store or if you duplicate it, 
it will still work. You can conclude that hits with the full name 
comes from the FAQ (maybe Bill Davis has a link to your page as well) 
while hits using the VFN comes from your own page.

NPDS gives some feedback for each HTTP request by clicking (if that option
has been selected in Prefs), but there is also a short code in the main
window which usually reads "SERV" after a successful query.  (This is
associated with the pull-down that lists the domains of the visitors, if you
are logging them).

I have also seen "ERR" which I assume means "error", and I have just now
noticed "RBT" - does this mean "reboot"?  Is it a report of an event, or a
request to restart the server?  Since it goes away and resumes showing
"SERV" on the next query, I would assume it is the former.  Wow I keep
finding features in this little marvel...

It means RoBoT.
Matt thought that crawlers should be bounced because they could be a 
weight for the small NPDS server. Since multiple connections, it's 
less the case, so I'll set this as an option (and remove the latency 
option).

Anyway, it occurs when someone tries to access the robots.txt file.

Which GIF Server are you using? The fast one which makes 4-bits depth Pictures with a realistic screenshot sound or the other one which makes B&W pictures?

If you're using the old one, I can't help. If you're using the new one, we could debug it on an MP2000. We need an MP 2000 with an internet connection and a connection to a desktop at the same time (serial or AppleTalk).

>Yeah, I saw that right after I sent my reply.

Too bad that Matt cannot use your tracker. This means that all cool 
feature we'll add will be reserved to your tracker only and that we 
would never use the share function, unless someone else wants to run 
a tracker. (maybe I'll run a tracker on my mac, though to know 
quickly when my Newton gets unexpectedly offline).

I thought of a new cool feature of the tracker we could implement: 
get a jump to URL. This would send you to a page telling you that the 
Newton is apparently offline if it is, or send you to the URL of the 
Newton. We could use the simple move temporary HTTP code (the server 
won't be used as a proxy).

This requires an ID in the Newton. We could even parse the host 
header if the tracker server has a unique IP, instead of having the 
Newton ID in the query string. NPDS webmasters would just have to 
choose a DNS from a free dynamic DNS server to point to the tracker 
server and the tracker server would send them to the Newton. What do 
you think about it?

Umm. Maybe we could discuss this on the NPDS mailing list. Cc'ed.

Indeed, I found your message dated 11/20/00 when you told me about 
this update. I told you I would try to find time to look at it, but 
finally, I haven't. I've been too busy with the ATA support package.

Or just get everyone to use the Tracker on eddie... the only downside is
that it sort of keeps Matt out of the loop.  And since the eddie tracker
is on port 2110, people behind strict firewalls won't be able to use it.

I'm going to start another tracker on my Cable Modem: it'll be at
npds.unna.org port 80.

I don't really understand this... so instead of providing a direct link to
the Newt, provide a link that checks it first and if it is up then
redirects to it or serves a page that says that it seems to be down?

Matt's tracker is very popular. And I preferred Matt's original idea 
of several trackers sharing entries.
(BTW, Matt told me he registered to the list today, but he's not in 
the list. Either the server doesn't update the list that frequently 
or he hasn't confirmed yet)

>I'm going to start another tracker on my Cable Modem: it'll be at
>npds.unna.org port 80.

You're using register.com service? Is it because their price 
(apparently 35 USD) is cheaper than for example Gandi's (12 EUR)? 
Because they offer DNS management as some free service around the web 
offers, too? Or is it because you like the ads they put at the bottom 
of the page as in some UNNA mirror and npds.unna.org?

>I don't really understand this... so instead of providing a direct link to

First option:
When you do (for example) eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca:2110/123456789/ it 
jumps either to the address of the Newton ID 123456789 or displays an 
error message.

Second option:
When you do (for example) foo.dyndns.org:2110 where foo.dyndns.org 
points to eddie's address, eddie detects that the host is 
foo.dyndns.org and either redirects to the Newton known to use this 
host or displays an error message.

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] 4 Bits GIF Server now posted

Hi all,

The 4 bits GIF server has been posted by Matt at http://130.126.50.66/npds/.
It seems rather stable so far.

About the other modules there, there are some bugs I fixed in the old 
version but also some bugs I have introduced. So you may want to stay 
with your old version if it works properly. All modules are 
compatible among versions.

Now, I think I remember that there is a big bug in the old tracker 
client which produces weird results on Matt's tracker in certain 
conditions. I have spent 20 minutes trying to fix it by unregistering 
and registering servers manually. So please update this to the latest 
new version (besides, the latest tracker client is not known to have 
any bug).

I'm working on a new version of NPDS. The new core is already much 
stronger than the previous one which Matt inherited from Ray's sample 
code. I am coding C++ functions to improve the responsiveness of the 
server. Currently I'm working on the query string parser and the POST 
body parser (yes, the new server will support POST requests and 
therefore will accept long notes to be posted). This new release will 
be incompatible with the old modules because the old modules relies 
on shared globals which is incompatible with multiple connections (if 
you really want to know, this is the cause of most problems with the 
latest release).

Once the new version is functionnal here, I'll send it to any thrill 
seeker who wants to try it. Please note that you won't be able to 
revert from the new version to the old (you'll lose your preferences).

Subject: [NPDS] Matt's tracker's bugs

Hi all,

this is a bug report for everyone because I'm tired of fixing the 
tracker manually.

The biggest problem is the following. When you do:

REGUP 127.0.0.1 foo
REGUP 127.0.0.2 bar
REGUP 127.0.0.3 foo

You have:

127.0.0.1	foo
127.0.0.3	bar

So please folks, if your address changed, unregister first. To do so, 
open the latest tracker client (available at 
http://130.126.50.66/npds/) and press the =[ ]= button. If you don't 
do that, the latest server registered will have your address, and as 
you kept the old address, you'll disapear from the list after n 
unsuccessful accesses to the traq/confirm.ns page.

To fix things manually is the more painful because there is another 
bug (I now know this bug, so it should be fine).
Matt's tracker apparently doesn't work with:
"REGDN 127.0.0.1" & CRLF

It requires an extra character at the end (such as a space). The 
tracker client works fine. It's just that telnetting requires to add 
this character. I don't know why.

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS Live Chat

Hi all,

Harri Hohteri suggested that we had a live chat on NPDS. I was 
wondering what you thought about it. The idea is to enable chatting 
with vistors AND the owner, instead of using the instant 
message/screen shot way.

I also wondered of the technical ways to do it.
Harri pointed out a web site for a TV which does have a live chat. It 
works by not closing the stream and sending new lines to every stream 
(there is one stream per user). This is nice but it doesn't work on 
iCab and Newtscape (and maybe NetHopper) which requires the stream to 
be closed before processing the page (it's a stupid behavior, I know).

Another way would be to use a Java applet, but not everybody has Java.
Or we could have a re-load to re-load the page every x minutes.
Or we could have a NewtonScript code for Newtscape clients.

Any comment?

Oh, something else. With all these features, I'm scared that we 
explode the counter. Maybe we could think about limiting the counter 
to hits to the home page? Or to sessions? (I prefer sessions as 
apparently many visitors to my Newton server have a bookmark of some 
pages).

Personally, if it's doable without adding too much bloat, I'd say go for it.
Although, it's not important enough to me to delay other programming
efforts, bug fixes, enhancements already in line, etc.

I'm still hoping, forlornly by now, that Matt's original idea of being able
to post to Dates will be implemented/released. I feel the lack of this
every single day. Live Chat would be 'slick' but I'd rather see the
resources, i.e. your time ;-) , invested in Date-posting and strengthening
Note-posting, which, on my machine at least has a tendency to post empty
notes (i.e. 'forget' the ontent being posted).  Just my $0.02...

I would have to agree with John. Features such as the ones he 
mentioned... in fact, any enhancements to remote data manipulation, and 
perhaps more flexible page counting/filtering would be more useful 
additions.

However, a two way live chat mechanism would be useful in many 
situations. Maybe it might work better as a standalone package rather 
than as another feature running on top of NPDS.

And Paul Guyot mentioned:

If you're interested specifically in pure traffic numbers, session 
counting is much more useful. Page hits is valuable, only if you are 
concerned with what people are looking at and how much they viewed while 
visiting. Many people still equate page views and hits directly to visits 
or sessions. It really comes down to how you want to measure your traffic 
and throughput. A user-selectable set of options to configure the counter 
would be useful to me.

And now that my DSL connection is almost completely installed, I'll be 
able to get my spare 2100 running with NPDS full time. Woo hoo!

OK folks, you were heard. I'll work on Dates first (and 
authentification, which is linked).
My priority is the core of NPDS.

Anyway, it would be handled by a module.

What I meant is that page hits will be any hit, not just pages. We'll 
have much bigger values than the one we were used to.

From: Matt Vaughn <nospam_mwvaugh_at_life.uiuc_dot_edu>

I think this is a great idea and would be simple to implement.

A simple NPDS module has an array of postings with the following slots

Username (chosen by the user at first sign-on), Chat text, Time, and IP
address (for logging)

You have a page user can visit that shows the chat in action. The page has a
meta tag in the header that forces a reload once every 30 seconds. It will
also reload instantly if the user submits anything. Keep reloading the page
and voila, semi-live chat.

WELCOME TO NPDS CHAT

POST TO NPDS CHAT
Username: [      ]
Text: [               ] <Submit> <Clear>
-----------------------------------

Upon submission, the posting is processed and added to the array, sorted by
submission time, and the new page HTML is returned to the user. This is
bare-bones simple and side-steps the need for Java or streaming or anything
like that. You could store the username in a single-session cookie so that
the user would only have to enter it once.

You could easily write a GUI front end for the module so that the Newton
owner could participate in the chat without using the intermediate HTTP
interface.

Well, the problem is randomly working proxies such as mine, so we 
should forget the IP idea (which isn't required anyway, I know how to 
do it, even without a cookie - I've done that in the past for a 
customer who never paid me)

This is one of the solutions, indeed. It should be enough as the 
owner of the Newton enters text with a pen (well, normally, be he 
could log from the desktop and type with a keyboard).

However, we should narrow the moments when the Newton beeps and when 
the counter is increased.

Especially these sucking recursive and dirty make files of GnuMake. Beurk.

The best then is to use frames.
(we could use HTML 4.0.1 frameset to still be 4.0.1 compliant)

I thought of a cookie, but for Instant messages and posts. We could 
even share this cookie among NPDS servers if the browser accepts to 
share cookies.

Of course. The user could also say if he is here or away. This would 
be a great feature to add, but other webmasters prefer that I work 
first on the Dates module, and so will I.

Hi Matt & folks,

Matt's tracker (http://130.126.50.66/tracker.cgi) is down again. It 
no longer answers on port 2110. I suggest that you use Victor's 
tracker until Matt's tracker is restarted. To register on Victor's 
tracker (BTW, Victor, will we have the 0.1.21 version?), set the 
following tracker settings:
Server: eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca
Newton Port: 2110
Path:
HTTP Port: 2110

My screen (http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/html/screen) is showing the 
proper settings. Don't worry about changing the settings, the Newton 
will remember the old settings and you'll be able to switch using the 
diamond popup.

FYI, the proper settings for Matt's tracker are:
Server: 130.126.50.66
Newton Port: 2110
Path: tracker.cgi
HTTP Port: 80

To (un)register your Newton press the UP (=[]=) button in the tracker 
client. (the Newton is automatically registered when you start the 
server and unregistered when you stop it).

Victor, would it be possible to post these settings on the main tracker 
page, specifically for those people who may stumble across the tracker, 
but haven't configured the client yet? As well, having the standard 
client settings mentioned on Matt's tracker page might be useful, to 
those people who may have forgotten the default settings after wiping 
their Newtons...

Just a thought.

Great idea, I just did it.

Here's something for the wish list.

I would dearly love to have the ability to specify different (or at least 
be able to globally edit) HTML templates for the various NPDS-generated 
pages, including but not limited to:

/pager/index.html
/html/postnote.html
/dates/index.html
/dates/day.html
/dates/week.html
/dates/search.html
/traq/index.html

...etc.

As well as the 404 and invalid admin access error pages...

The fact that I can globally control the typography and page element 
colors via the style sheet is one thing, but table layout, page width, 
and page alignment properties are something else altogether.

How difficult would it be to allow access to even a subset of the 
internal HTML templating?

Good news. I was pretty sure I read through that document, but I must 
have missed it while skimming. I also like the mention of "* General use 
of icons for Newton look". This is referring to the served page and not 
just the user interface of the program, correct?

I decided that the rest of this thread should probably move to this list.

In a previous message on another list Paul Filmer typed:

>I have installed HeapMagic, and de-activated Avi's -
>I'll see if my NPDS server survives the night.

I installed Heap Magic too, and the system seems to have stabilized a bit 
and is no longer freezing. The automatic garbage collection seems to be 
working fairly well.

However... NPDS just stops accepting http connections after a while. It 
hasn't hung up, as I can still access all the plug-ins and prefs 
settings. My ethernet adapter and the DSL modem lights indicate that I 
have a proper connection. I can ping and traceroute the IP, but can't 
access the server via a browser.

Stopping and starting the server (without exiting the app) seems to clear 
up the problem. Is there any way I could monitor this using the log file 
or a debugger?

Would a low latency setting have any bearing on this problem?

Actually, installing Heap Magic was a good idea.
Deactivating Avi's BD isn't, though.

This is a known bug.
This is only caused by NPDS/NIE.
Playing with Heap Magic or whatever won't help.

Indeed. There is two other problems:
- the -16022 error dialog (shows the last request NPDS will accept)
- the freeze bug

There are other known bugs:
- the log bug (some requests are not logged)

>Is there any way I could monitor this using the log file
>or a debugger?

No.

>Would a low latency setting have any bearing on this problem?

Deactivating the reverse DNS or even the stats (log) may help.
But there is a big bug in that. The cause is the hacked NPDS core. 
Sorry for that, but I can't fix that without re-writing the whole 
core (which I have started, BTW). The other way would be to get an 
older version of the core (one which wouldn't accept multiple 
connections). But I'm scared that this won't help as the older 
version had the same kind of bugs.

Help!

I haven't run NPDS is awhile, but I ran it overnight, and whenever I (or
anyone else) tries to view my screen through the GIF module, it crashes
the Newt! I'm definitely running the latest version (fast 4-bit), on a
MP2100. The version I have doesn't have a version number, but it was
installed in October of last year, and it says under 'pkg info' that it
was created Oct. 9 of 2000. It worked fine the first time I accessed it,
but now it crashes every time...

Any ideas?

Only one version of this package (still officially a beta) was released.

Weird.

Could you please have NTK running and connected to your Newton and 
then try to get a screen shot? The current releases sends 
informations to the inspector and this could help.

How much space left do you have on the various stores? How much 
NewtonScript heap left do you have?

Paul,

Saw your response on the NPDS list, but I'm afraid I'm not really a
developer; I don't have NTK installed. I tried once, just to see what it
was all about, but was missing some part or other that kept it from
launching...

> How much space left do you have on the various stores?

I have 1098k free on internal, and 13,003k free on a 32Meg card.

> How much NewtonScript heap left do you have?

<red face> I'm afraid I don't know how to tell how much of that I have
left...

If I can find NTK on UNNA, I might be able to get it up and running
sometime... It's not a big deal though, because I'm out the door
tomorrow for a two-week vacation. I'm going to be bonkers-busy when I
get back, so who knows when I'll have time to do some detective work on
this. Let me know if there's somewhere else I need to look for NTK, and
otherwise don't worry about this anymore. I'm sure you've already got
more than enough to worry about as it is! ;-p

Thanks for your response, regardless,
John

Just a quick update...

Since installing Heap Magic, NPDS has been working fine. No freezes. No 
missing connections. Nearly 26 hours without a burp. Over 300 hits in 
all. But then I got the dreaded -16022 (internet?) error which seemed to 
have hung up NPDS.

Oh well, it is working better than before... and no heap-specific issues. 
I'll just have to keep an eye on it. Thanks for everybody's help.

There are many NS Heap indicators around, e.g. Dash Board's, Avi's BD, etc.

Forget it, it's rather a pain to get all elements to install NTK. I 
wonder if there is a bug in this server as it works wonderfully well 
here, but some have reported restarts and think the GIF server is in 
cause. Anyway, I don't have much time for that either. We'll see with 
NPDS 3.x if you still experience restarts.

Hi all,

Matt's tracker no longer responds on port 2110, which means that you 
can't register/unregister your Newton.

I don't remind you that you can register on Victor's tracker and that 
the settings are eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca for server, 2110 for Newton 
Port and HTTP port and nothing for path.

BTW, I made an anotated screen shot about how to configure the client 
for both trackers:

I had the same problem at one point with the newer GIF Module.  I found
that flushing the cache and erasing the NPDS entry under Storage
eventually cleared up the problem.  It's been a while, and I do not think
I had to reinstall the GIF Module itself; I just trashed any preferences
or cached info.

HTH,

Josh

Hi Victor.

I noticed that when you posted the new version of your tracker, the 
client settings information is no longer there. Could that chunk of text 
be appended to the tracker page using a include file, so that it's always 
referenced when the tracker gets recompiled?

Just thought I'd let you know.

Subject: [NPDS] Bad data returned from search form

Hello,

I have noticed that the search form, when used to query the filed notes returns
a url that does not work. It is thus:
/html/-183691048$45.nsd.nsd
but should clearly be thus:
/html/-183691048$45.nsd

How can this be fixed?
You can try it out at http://paleonews.dartmouth.edu
I think I have the latest versions of the various NPDS components.

While I have your attention, can anyone tell me how to change the sort order in
the listings of notes/web posting? I would prefer to list most recent first, not
last.

Regards,

Chuck

Actually, the server 0.1.20 used two files for the header and the 
footer. 0.1.22 now uses a single template file instead. When I built 
this template file, I looked at what was then on Victor's tracker. It 
was a little bit before he added the informations for how to register 
on his tracker. I made a new template file I sent him, but he hasn't 
found the time to install it yet.

Besides, I made an annotated screen shot of the client to show you 
how to set it up. It can be found at:
http://www.kallisys.com/images/client-setup.gif

The settings informations are the following:

Matt's tracker
server: 130.126.50.66
Newton Port: 2110
Path: tracker.cgi
HTTP Port: 80

Victor's tracker
server: eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca

Leave the path blank

Reinstalling the GIF Module can't help actually.

Wow, I forgot this bug.

You need a Mac and MacOS Voice recognition technology (and of course 
a plain talk microphone). It's better to have Mexican TTS as well. 
Choose carlos in the voices.
Get the source from http://130.126.50.66/npds/current/
Connect your Newton to the mac.
Turn NPDS off.
Turn recognition on on the mac.
Say: Please fix the bugs in NPDS.
Wait.
Wait.
There is normally no need to reinstall the packages on your Newton.

If it failed, it is because the Mac didn't understand what you said. 
Try to repeat steps 4 to 6.

BTW, if you finally succeeded (my accent is so bad I wasn't able to 
do it), please send the packages to Matt. He will surely post them 
ASAP.

OK, I'll add that to the to-do list.

Subject: [NPDS] noteserver 'bug'

Hello,

I installed the following  parts of NPDS :
nHTTPDSetup 2.021
nHHTPD 2.034
NotepadServer 2.041
NPDSTraqClient 2.032
WebPager2.023
Cardserver and dateserver are from the 2.02 package.
When I use the noteserver 2.041 the notes/pages in the WWW folder are not
shown by the SSI <NOTE_LIST> does always return (No files). The notes in
the post folder do show with the <POST_LIST> SSI. If I access a note in
the WWW folder directly by its title, it shows up.

Any clues?

Ron

Hi folks,

Both NPDS trackers are down.
The 2110 port of both is closed.

I just brought eddie back up.  The server was doing some strange things
last night (like being unable to spawn new processes) so that might have
been why it went doen.

Hi,

It seems like both trackers are down again.
Is there an estimated time when they will be up again?

Eddie is up here. I haven't been able to access Matt's tracker for 
several hours. As I have problems with my ISP, I wasn't sure.

Eddie isn't responsive when doing the check of Newtons which can take 
quite a while if there are disconnected Newtons.
This is a known bug of eddie. I can't fix it because I can't install 
the Java dev tools.

I don't remember if we said that we could post packages to the list 
or not, so I don't post this new release to the list directly.

This new version of NoteServ fixes the search bug. It also updates 
the version number (which was 2.03 in the 2.041 package). Upgrading 
to 2.042 may mean losing one's NoteServ settings. Personally, I had 
to restart the Newton as I got an exception because the prefs were 
deleted by the check version method (in the nHTTPd module). Anyway, 
if you want the package (or the source), just ask, or wait for Matt 
to post it to his website.

When browsing my NPDS mailing list folder, I found this post which

This is really weird.
Here, both tags (I tried it, I normally only use the NOTE_TABLE and 
POST_TABLE SSIs) work perfectly.

Anyone experienced the same problem?

Are you or have you been using SuperNotePad?

Oh, I found the explanation, sorry.

Here is the way these folders work (it's different than from the time 
there were a single folder):

a/ Folder: anything which is public but NOT shown in neither the 
NOTE_ or POST_ SSIs.
b/ Post: anything which is shown in either NOTE_ or POST_ depending 
on the fact it was posted by someone with the whiteboard or just 
moved by yourself to this folder on the Newton.

So you may want to move your WWW notes to the Post folder.
index.html has to be in WWW folder (for security reasons, there was a 
security hole in the previous versions of NoteServ).

I know it's a little bit confusing. I planned to re-design this whole 
part (among other things) if I find a way to sleep less than 30 
minutes per day.

Here's what Paul has to say about it:

Hi all,

It's been a long time since Matt's tracker was last down. It's the 
case right now. The port 2110 is closed.

BTW, Matt, I noticed that the tracker.cgi cgi doesn't send any header 
so lynx refuses to display the page and w3m doesn't interpret the 
page. If you could please fix that, it would be great.

Victor, can we expect eddie running the tracker again? Or shall we 
look for another host?

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Matt's tracker down again

I'll re-boot it when I go to the lab. However, we need to have a small 
discussion regarding the tracker service I've willingly provided for the 
last couple of years.

<FINGERS CROSSED>I'm finally getting my doctorate and leaving at the end 
of July</FINGERS CROSSED>.

I don't know where I'm going, but it's not likely that I'll have a fleet 
of computers where I have enough free reign to run my own server. I can, 
perhaps, leave the tracker running for a while back at U of Illinois, 
but eventually my old lab is going to want to shut it down.

So, we need to find someone who can run either the Java version of the 
tracker (which I would prefer since it's cross-platform) or my strictly 
Macintosh-based one.
I'm not 100% out of the running as far as providing the service goes, 
but I can't promise anything at this point. So the question becomes "If 
Matt Vaughn was hit by a bus, who would host the tracker?"

Cheers,

Matt

I don't know when eddie is going to get fixed.  What happened was that it
got rebuilt with a new system drive and a fresh install of FreeBSD 4.1,
which seems to have broken java for some reason.

Right now, I've brought back my other NPDS server, which is running on
misato.chuma.org port 2110.  I will keep this one up, but it's on a less
reliable net connection than eddie (cable modem vs. University T3s)

How much overhead does the tracker need in terms of RAM and Mhz? I could 
either host it on the same Powermac 9500 that I have IPNetRouter and 
QuickDNS on, or I could potentially resurrect one of the 6100's I have in 
the basement and have the tracker run on it. What would be ideal is if 
the tracker could be monitored using PageSentry or Rebound! and then 
restarted automatically if it ever went kerflunky.

Depends on which tracker server you're talking about.
Matt's tracker seems to be rather light, but it needs to be fixed as 
it goes down on a regular basis :-)
Victor's tracker is in Java and this means it requires quite a lot of 
CPU on MacOS.

The Mac-only version runs well on a Powermac 7200 with 48 M of RAM. 
Actually, the program itself only requires 2 megs of RAM and just a few 
MHz. The HTTP server capacity can be furnished by any Mac web server 
that handles apple event CGIs. I host the tracker using Personal Web 
Sharing, for instance.

Now, the Java version requires about 8 M of RAM and again, the same PM 
7200/90 MHz actually ran it quite well. I don't have as much experience 
with it but I was able to package an early version of Victor's tracker 
code into a Mac app and it substituted OK for a few days.

Now that I think about it, the Java version runs like a dream on MacOS X

I compiled it without any trouble using CodeWarrior. I can do it 
again, I still have the project somewhere (the tracker comes as a 
single source file, so it's pretty easy to compile, much easier than 
Waba apps for the Newton :-)

However, when running on this G3/233 with CodeWarrior and a couple 
(say 20) other applications, it really slows down the machine 
(especially during checks). If you don't use the machine, it's ok. If 
you do, you'd better have a stronger unit or run a Unix as MRJ is so 
slow and big.

If the Java version is more stable, I would be willing to run a headless 
6100 with the just the tracker.cgi and MacHTTP 2.4b3. I can easily give 
the box decent amount of RAM by cannibalizing some of my other in stasis 
machines. I have to put all this old hardware to use somehow...

You don't need MacHTTP 2.4b3.
The Java version is a standalone HTTP 1.0 (er, even less I think) 
server on port 2110.

BTW, if you want to register on misato (so I'm not feeling lonely) 
http://misato.chuma.org:2110, just do as for Victor's tracker (eddie) 
but replace eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca by misato.chuma.org.

Hi folks,

There is a new version of GIF Server.
I lost the const.f file, so the colors are not exactly the same (when 
the backlight is on)

New features:

a/ you can set the GIF Server in private mode. In that case, it will 
serve the login screen.
b/ you can set the GIF Server in quiet mode. It will then no longer 
do the screen shot sound.

I've just sent the package to Matt. So either wait until he posts it 
to the NPDS update page or ask me privately if you want the package.

Sounds like an opportunity to request a couple of features...

What if the backlight-on and backlight-off colors were user selectable 
using standard HTML or CSS hex values? These background colors could be 
fine-tuned by the owner to match any colors that may be used as part of 
the template style sheet or other HTML values. Additionally, the separate 
coloring of the backlight-on screen shots could be optionally turned off 
as well. With this option turned off, all of your screen shots could 
appear the same regardless of the state of the physical backlight.

It's all about aesthetics I guess...

Actually, you'd only need six sliders (or an alphanumeric picker, like 
the way you set requests and log entry expiration in the nHTTP app), 
three each for the backlight-on and backlight-off background colors.

GIFMaker was/is the old B&W GIF server, written in NS, by Toad Hollow
Software.  It has nothing to do with Paul's (fast, written in C++, 4-bit)
server.

Or, if you wanted to tint the image instead of just replacing white with
another colour, you'd just need sliders for the Hue value, right?  (Hey,
let's mix RGB with HSV!  Yeah!  It's even easier when Paul writes al the
code!  :)

You mean with an algorithm to compute the levels?
And maybe a nice curve to choose how much linear the difference 
between the levels should be?

You mean that we could have some constants that NPDS will replace 
with values in the CSS depending on the state of the backlight? Just 
to have different colors in the HTML if the backlight is on or off?

But wasn't there two components to the GIF server? GIFMaker and

Oh my word... the mind boggles. Perhaps a user-selectable colorspace, so 
we could use Lab or CMYK approximations as well... Hey Paul, could you 
look at porting ColorSync? :)

>You mean with an algorithm to compute the levels?

I guess I was just thinking of a simple linear slider that changed each 
of the RGB values from 00 to FF. A curve would be nice, but it sounds 
like overkill to me.

Well, originally I was just thinking of different colors of each of the 
states not necessarily linked in any way to the NPDS CSS, but thinking 
about it again... it may be interesting to include a value in the main 
style sheet specifically for the GIFServer.

Indeed.
There was the Newton bitmap to GIF code (in NewtonScript)
and the NPDS package plus the interface.

Here it's all in one.

BTW, the C++ function is passed an array of two or 16 colors, so if 
you want to edit them directly (as packed RGB ints :-), I can read 
them from prefs. The interface would then be any soup editor.

:-)

In fact, PackRGB integers are made of 0000 to FFFF values, although 
not all values are accessible (the integer is 28 bits long). Then the 
GIF Lib converts them to 00 to FF.

I don't mind at all!

The reason your having this problem is a function of the Linksys.

I will try not to go into too much detail, but I hope it is enough for you to
fix your problem.


First I will describe what is going on here so you can get a better
understanding (solution will be below).

The Linksys router/firewall"s "outside" port takes the valid IP address that
@home has assigned to you. Then the Linksys assigns all other devices
connected to the "inside" port private IP addresses via a built in DHCP
server. All the devices with private IP addresses can't directly communicate
with the Internet, so the firewall then acts as a translator to all
communications going in and out of itself. It will translate and allow all
transmissions originating from the "inside" of the firewall, and send them to
the "outside" port and to the Internet. In term, it will also allow only
translate responses to those transmissions to pass back through it to the
"inside". This creates the "Firewall" that keeps any "outside" transmissions
from reaching your "inside" devices.

The good thing is, by doing this it is protecting you against people viewing
or hacking you devices on the inside.
The Bad thing is, it stops transmissions you may want from coming through the
firewall (like people trying to access your Newton.


SOLUTION!

Some firewalls, that are like your Linksys, are able to be configured
(usually through a web browser).
Now I don't know what features your firewall will allow you to configure, but
you will need to tell your firewall to let transmissions that are looking for
a web page (TCP port 80), to come through it.
They usually call these settings "Inbound mappings" or something.
You need to set your firewall to let all TCP port 80 transmissions from the
"outside" to go to the "inside" private IP address of your Newton.
Look through your manual, call them or go to Linksys' web page to find out
how to configure your firewall to do this.

Now another thing you might want to do is set your Newton to always use the
same IP address that your firewall configuration uses.

I hope this helps you out!
Sorry if it's a bit long winded : )

Hi Folks,

I've been using successfully the nHTTPd Pre2.035 package for 12 hours 
or so. It fixes two bugs in the TCP Server which made the Newton to 
no longer serve pages. However, it doesn't fix another bug leading to 
a dialog saying Internet Error -16022. If you have such an error, 
please note what's in the alert exactly (if it's Listen CB or 
something else) and report that to me. Also, tell me if it happened 
just after a screen shot sound or not. In any case, you'll have to 
restart the server just after such an alert.

OK, I don't think this version is worth being posted on Matt's NPDS 
update page. It's just a 5 mins fix of the TCP Server I have made 
because I was tired of the server going down all the time (hence it's 
Pre2.035, not 2.035). You can get it from my Newton, though at 
http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/bin/nHTTPd-Pre2.035.pkg.zip.

I don't mind at all!

The reason your having this problem is a function of the Linksys.

I will try not to go into too much detail, but I hope it is enough for
you to
fix your problem.


First I will describe what is going on here so you can get a better
understanding (solution will be below).

The Linksys router/firewall"s "outside" port takes the valid IP address that
@home has assigned to you. Then the Linksys assigns all other devices
connected to the "inside" port private IP addresses via a built in DHCP
server. All the devices with private IP addresses can't directly communicate
with the Internet, so the firewall then acts as a translator to all
communications going in and out of itself. It will translate and allow all
transmissions originating from the "inside" of the firewall, and send
them to
the "outside" port and to the Internet. In term, it will also allow only
translate responses to those transmissions to pass back through it to the
"inside". This creates the "Firewall" that keeps any "outside" transmissions
from reaching your "inside" devices.

The good thing is, by doing this it is protecting you against people viewing
or hacking you devices on the inside.
The Bad thing is, it stops transmissions you may want from coming
through the
firewall (like people trying to access your Newton.


SOLUTION!

Some firewalls, that are like your Linksys, are able to be configured
(usually through a web browser).
Now I don't know what features your firewall will allow you to
configure, but
you will need to tell your firewall to let transmissions that are
looking for
a web page (TCP port 80), to come through it.
They usually call these settings "Inbound mappings" or something.
You need to set your firewall to let all TCP port 80 transmissions from the
"outside" to go to the "inside" private IP address of your Newton.
Look through your manual, call them or go to Linksys' web page to find out
how to configure your firewall to do this.

Now another thing you might want to do is set your Newton to always use the
same IP address that your firewall configuration uses.

I hope this helps you out!
Sorry if it's a bit long winded : )

>Since installing 2.035 my Newton ,sü't tracked by Matt's or Victor's trackers.

By Victor's trackers, what do you mean? misato.chuma.org seems to 
work so far. Eddie no longer works because the server doesn't have 
Java running properly.

>I reinstalled the Tracker client. Any other ideas?
>
>The server runs, but never shows up in a tracker. I can connect to it.

The problem is that Matt's tracker is down. A way to tell is to try 
to telnet on port 2110 and then type ABOUT. But now, the port is 
closed while it shouldn't. Another way to tell is to open the tracker 
client and press the UP button. If the tracker client window is 
closed immediatly, it's that the port is closed (and the tracker is 
down). Next version of the client will tell you when the tracker is 
down.

BTW, I exceeded my upload limit (mainly because of the work on 
NewtonDev archive) - I have 4 MB per day plus 250 MB per month, and 
I'm at 257 MB now - so I'm limiting my use of internet to upload less 
than 4 MB per day, and therefore I no longer serve pages until 
Friday. Sorry for those who wanted to download nHTTPd Pre2.035 or GIF 
Server 1.1 from my Newton.

From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Hi Paul.

It seems that everytime I attempt to download the Pre2.035 version of 
nHTTPd from your Newton, first I get a connection failure midway through 
the download and then when I try it again, the whole NPDS server appears 
to be dead. This is the link that I am using:

http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/bin/nHTTPd-Pre2.035.pkg.zip

I did successfully download the 1.1 version of the GIFServer.

Is this just an NPDS hiccup that happens when serving the binaries?

I don't know. I have noticed the same problem when trying to download 
the binary from a remote server. But I can download it without any 
problem from the mac to the Newton.
I wonder if it's a bug in the binary server or NPDS or a problem with 
my internet connection (I am apparently losing 3% of packets to the 
US). Were you able to get a complete screenshot?

BTW, I told you that the binary server was experimental ;)

Subject: [NPDS] misato.chuma.org tracker


The tracker at misato has been down for a while.  This is because we've
discovered a problem with Java and 'dyndns' host names.  The problem is
that once Java looks up a host name, it caches the IP address
indefinately.  There is no way to flush this cache or force a fresh
lookup.  So, if you change the IP address for your dyndns host name,
the tracker will never be able to find your NPDS server again, because it
will be trying to contact the old IP address.

The (apparent) fix for this is either to wait until Java 1.4, or set a
parameter in Java 1.2 or later to control the amount of time that Java
caches the IP addresses.  Unfortunately, when I turned this option on it
started triggering server checks every minute.  I shut it off and haven't
had time to look at it yet.

Just thought y'all might like to know.

This applied directly to my server, since due to a firewall change here, my

I just tried hitting the server again, and took a screenshot prior to 
downloading the binary package. You can see the screenshot here:

http://www.splorp.com/splorp/junk/screenpg010614.gif

I got another connection error after clicking on the download link and

I knew that, and had my fingers crossed. Everything else on your server 
works fine... it's just that one link. I wanted to get a copy of Pre2.035 
anyway. Could you send me a copy via email?

Thanks.

Oh, I see. I guess it's because of the NPDS bug which has a bad 
tendency to happen with binary serving.

BTW, Paul Filmer said that he was able to get both Newton packages 
and a screen shot without any problem.

I recently joined the list and see some traffic but don't have anything

NPDS mailing list isn't indeed a very high traffic mailing list.

There are 31 subscribers on the list.

In spite of the fact that it's powered by Listar (just like 
NewtonTalk, but on the contrary to NewtonTalk <hint>, it doesn't have 
any <hint> QP problem :), archiving is not enabled (and I think could 
not be).

However, I could put the digests somewhere if you're really interested.

Hey everyone,

The Java NPDS tracker at misato.chuma.org:2110 is back up.  We've fixed
the problem with 'dynamic' DNS entries, so you should be able to use them
with no problems.

Subject: [NPDS] Matt's tracker and DNS

Hi folks,

Once upon a time, Victor's tracker (http://misato.chuma.org:2110) had 
a problem with domain names. It happened to be a bug in Java, and it 
has now been fixed. The problem was that the tracker cached forever 
the domain name information, and if the IP changed (typically when 
you were using a dyndns domain name), it wouldn't take this into 
account, and therefore would unregister you.

Apparently, Matt's tracker (read REALBasic) has the same bug. I have 
tried several times to register as newt.dyndns.org:8080, and in that 
case, Matt's tracker doesn't send any request to my Newton and marks 
me as offline although the Newton is still UP.

Hi all,

I've been making changes in Victor's Tracker, and basically, I fixed 
a couple of bugs, including the refresh 0 one Paul Filmer 
experienced. It should be more stable now.

I remind you that Victor fixed the domain name caching bug with 
0.1.23. I think that the tracker is pretty stable now, as it has been 
a long time since we haven't introduced new features ;)

Feel free to register on his tracker as well. Matt's tracker proved 
to not be terribly stable, so two trackers are better than one.

	As the developer of nBattleship, I can tell you that I'm not
updating the code to take advantage of a TCP/IP connection. That being

Hey all,
 
It looks like Matt's NPDS tracker (at 130.126.50.66) is down pretty hard.
In the meantime, you can use the (much more stable) Java tracker at
misato.chuma.org (24.157.128.19).  Just change the server setting in the
Tracker Client from 130.126.50.66 to 24.157.128.19, and don't forget to
save your prefs.

And if anyone has a stable server that is Java-capable and wants to run a
secondary tracker server, mail me off-list.  The server-sharing feature is
completely operable in the Java server - so if there were multiple Java
servers, we'd be able to have them all share their registered servers -
but right now there's only mine :(

Thanks. I...uh... kinda know what that means ;-) at least the buffer 
overflow part.

Not so clear on "executes under the privledges of the web server process", 
tho'...
and clueless re CR1&2...

Congratulations on your latest "project", btw...

Thanks to the gracious demeanor of Adam Tow, I am running a newer version 
of the server (2.036) that Paul Guyot has been working on and Adam has 
been fiddling with in terms of interface.

This version crashes nearly as much as the current release version 
(2.034), but it also comes with another package called NPDS Watcher. If 
the server crashes, the watcher plug-in will automatically reboot the 
Newton.

This version should be released as soon as Paul get back from vacation. 
Keep an eye out for more information on his Newton server.

		[NPDS] [ANN] Mailing List Archives available

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: Mon, 13 Aug 2001 10:14:47 +0200
From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Watcher 008ac, Server 2.037 and Tracker Client 2.034

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce these new versions of modules of NPDS.

=== Watcher 008ac ===
Watcher is a new module created by Adam. It was designed to reboot 
the Newton if a problem occurs and it does restart the server if the 
Newton was rebooting while serving pages. It apparently reboots the 
Newton if every causes of non serving occurs (it successfully kept my 
Newton serving pages for 3 weeks without human interaction), 
including a reboot if the NewtonScript task crashed.

Several notes regarding this module (call this a help manual):

*** Preferences ***
- Launch NPDS after device reset: seems pretty obvious. Any reset 
will restart NPDS. However, the reset has to behave properly. I left 
my Newton on its own for one week and after 4 or 5 days, it stopped 
serving pages apparently because it crashed while rebooting (probably 
a -10061).
- Minimize NPDS Watcher on startup: obvious as well.
- Check Every: pretty obvious as well. See later for how to choose this value.
- Check if the NS Task is alive: this is the NewtonScript task 
watcher. See below.
- Alarm Sound: the watcher will count down from X to 0 before 
rebooting the Newton with a big loud sound. Choose the sound you want.
- Display Reboot dialog: display a dialog to reboot the Newton. If 
unchecked, the Watcher won't ask your opinion and reboot anyway. 
Note: if the problem is detected by the NewtonScript task watcher, 
the Newton will reboot without a dialog whatever the state of this 
check box is (I can't display a dialog if the NS Task crashed).
- Reboot delay: X in the previous paragraph.
- Startup NPDS after 5 secs: under some circumstances, you might need 
this check box checked for a proper restart of the server. I don't 
need it, but Adam does.

*** What is checked? ***
There are several checks done. Knowing what is checked will help you 
choose how to configure the watcher.
a/ the error message check. Checks if the frontmost view is an error 
message from the server. This means that if an error message comes 
from the server and you dismiss it, the watcher won't reboot (and the 
server is down at this point).
b/ the port open check. Checks if we can listen on the port the 
server is supposed to listen on. If we can, it means that the server 
is no longer listening. Note: this could interfere with the server 
because there is a moment when it's not listening and this is normal. 
Checking too often increase the risk that the watcher will try to 
listen at this moment (however, the risk is pretty low).
c/ the NewtonScript task watcher. This checks that the NewtonScript 
task goes idle often enough. If it didn't go idle for 4 periods, the 
Newton is rebooted.

The programmer's documentation specify that you shouldn't have a long 
operation without letting the task going idle (going idle is 
important as it's responsible for maintenance things such as turning 
backlight off, etc.). The system follows this recommandation, and 
everytime you have a long operation (e.g. find something on the 
Newton, print/beam/send or receive mail, etc.), there is a progress 
dialog (progress dialogs ensure that the task goes idle).
However, there are several programs which don't follow this rules, 
e.g. Deep Green, Fractals, etc. If you run such a program, the 
NewtonScript task watcher will think that the NS Task is dead while 
it isn't (but indeed, the server will be non responding). The 
solution is to increase the period.

*** Known bugs & limitations ***
- I'm not sure that everything is fine if the module is closed, so 
keep it minimized (in the star menu).
- if you say check every x minutes and you open the prefs again, it 
will show "check every x * 60 seconds" <-- I have just noticed this 
bug.
- There might be some additionnal aesthetic bugs I left before 
leaving for holidays.

Watcher requires Server 2.036 or later (2.037 is recommanded).

=== Server 2.037 ===

This new version includes a couple of changes since 2.034:

04/07/2001	2.037 [Paul Guyot]
	Fixed the StartServing method.

29/06/2001	2.036 [Adam Tow]
	- Changed the UI of the nHTTPd application. Buttons and 
controls more cleanly laid out
	- Updated the IP Address field (vIPField) to display the 
current public IP address of the device instead of the LAN address. 
Make a call to the TraqMe client app to retrieve the public IP 
address (GetPublicIP).

27/05/2001	2.035 [Paul Guyot]
	Fixed two bugs in the TCP/IP server.
	Better alerts in the TCP/IP server to track two other known bugs.

In a nutshell: Adam redesigned the UI, I fixed a couple of bugs in 
the server (since Pre2.035 in fact), and changes have been made to 
work with the Watcher.

There are still bugs left (hence the need of the watcher ;).

Server 2.037 requires Tracker Client 2.034

=== Tracker Client 2.034 ===

There have been a couple of changes since 2.032:

13/08/2001 2.034 [Paul Guyot]
	Aesthetic changes.
	The client no longer asks the main module for the IP but 
grabs it itself.
	Removed unnecessary files from the Thumb sample code.
	Made some clean up in the FSM.
	The client is now verbose and displays alerts when problems 
occur (hence we'll know immediatly if the tracker is down).
	Added a checkbox to use the private IP field instead of the 
Newton's IP.
	The return code of the server is tested (and if it's not 20X, 
an error message is displayed).

30/06/2001 2.033 [Adam Tow]
	Added GetPublicIP method to the main view to work with nHTTPd 2.036

The main new feature is that the tracker client will output an error 
if there is a problem with the tracker server. I suggest that you 
warn the administrator (either Matt or Victor) in such a case.
Also, I fixed a conflict with the server 2.037.

There is at least one bug left (when you press the REGUP button, 
sometimes, an exception occurs. Workaround: Close the application and 
open it again and retry). Oh, and I think that the deletion script is 
never called and the recent elements of the tracker client interface 
(e.g. the list of the tracker servers you entered) are never cleanup. 
I decided that it was not worth investigating.

=== General notes regarding updating ===

First, turn off the server. Install the new packages (be sure 
everything is on the same store), and check all the settings. 
Normally, the tracker client settings will be lost. The server 
settings might be lost as well. Then, reboot your Newton and turn the 
server on.

To be able to work with Adam, we set up an HTTP server to put files 
we're working on. New releases as well as sources will be found 
there, since apparently, Matt is pretty busy and usually doesn't have 
time to do the updates on his website. However, only the versions 
announced are supported. I don't want to spend my time explaining 
workarounds for unfinished versions.

These three modules can be found here:
http://npds.free.fr/NPDS%20Watcher/008ac_NPDS_Watcher.pkg
http://npds.free.fr/Server/nHTTPd-2.037.pkg
http://npds.free.fr/Tracker%20Client/NPDSTraq-Client-2.034.pkg

Sources are there as well, in stuffit archives.

I have encountered the following:

Occasionally a screen shot will give the broken image icon, and the nHTTPd
window on the server will revert to the size of the older versions (i.e. a
square rather than a rectangle, squashing all the buttons on the bottom
together).  Neither a Stop-Start recycle nor a close of the app will cure
this, it requires a soft reset.

I am running GIF Server v1 & nHTTPd v2.036 (2.037 was too unstable a while
ago, maybe I will retry it...)

This is a bug which occurs when you're reorienting the screen. I 
wonder what's the link with the GIF Server, but it's the only moment 
when the view bounds of the application is changed (and indeed, it 
resizes it to the old bounds).

I have fixed this bug and released it as 2.038. It's available here:
http://npds.free.fr/Server/

although only as a stuffit archive with the sources right now. The 
reason is that I have painful ISP problems right now, two connections 
with this FTP server which were broken and didn't timed out yet and 
therefore, it refuses me the access. I'll do the update tomorrow (I 
hope *every* ISP problems will be fixed tomorrow).

About problems, Matt's tracker seems down today.

I thought I fixed it, and indeed, it works pretty well when we're not 
serving, but when we are, it's worse than 2.037.

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] nHTTPd 2.038

Hi folks,

I've fixed the bugs I've introduced yesterday night trying to fix 
this rotate problem, so this time it's the real release of 2.038.
It's available as a package at:
http://npds.free.fr/Server/nHTTPd-2.038.pkg
And source is available as well:
http://npds.free.fr/Server/nHTTPd-2.038.sit

Changes are:

15/08/2001	2.038 [Paul Guyot]
- Fixed the ReorientToScreen method: the server is properly behaving 
on reorientation, and is not shown if it was minimized before 
reorientation.
Known limitation: when maximized, you see for a brief moment the stop 
button and the close box. I think it's not worth trying to fix it 
with more hacks in this code (if ever this is possible), we really 
need to change things and have the server able to serve pages even 
when the application is closed.
- Cleaned the viewQuitScript and the viewSetupFormScript.
- Removed some unused code here and there.
- Changed the status indicator messages. Now, possible values are:
  IDLE: not serving
  INIT: initiating the internet link
  RDY: ready to serve pages, didn't get any request yet
  SERV: last request was successfully completed
  400: last request was completed with a 400 error (Bad request)
  404: last request was completed with a 404 error (Resource not found)
  500: last request was completed with a 500 error (Internal error)
  RBT: last request was a robot (search engine) and I deflected it

Note: the supported version of nHTTPd is still 2.037 for at least one 
week, as I may very well have introduced new bugs.

Therefore, misato no longer checked if the servers were online. BTW, 
unfortunately, save of the registered servers and restore at restart 
hasn't been implemented yet.

And guess who triggered the bug by registering at the bad moment?

An update regarding my trials...

I have gone back to using 2.036 after trying both 2.038 (which seemed to 
generate a lot of errors in the process of tweaking prefs and dismissing 
dialog boxes) and 2.037 (which tends to crash and get restarted much more 
frequently than 2.036). I have also gone back to using 2.033 of the 
Tracker Client, as I kept getting the following error upon every restart:

     http://www.splorp.com/junk/screentracker010820.gif

Paul, I can get you a list of the specific errors that were being 
produced by 2.038 once I have a few minutes to reinstall that version.

More to follow...

Duh. John Skinner reported problems as well with 2.038, while nothing 
is reproduceable here. Anyone succeeded in using 2.038?

No, this isn't a bug in the tracker client.
It's what the server said. In the previous version, the tracker 
client didn't say anything whatever the server said. Now, it reports 
any message except 20X messages and any problem (so you know when the 
tracker goes down and so on).

Please install BugTrap from tactile systems and generate logs. The 
error number is completely useless for developers when the complex is 
a little bit complex.

I guessed as much. So the aforementioned error message is basically 
telling me that my Newton was probably not unregistered from the tracker 
server, and an attempt was made to re-register it once it restarted, 
correct? I'd like to suggest that the display of these messages be an 
option selectable via the prefs. It's a valid feedback mechanism, but I 
get tired of dismissing the windows.

You got it. BugTrap is installed and I'm about to load up the new 
packages again. I'll send the reports to the list if that's ok.

Paul, there are three sequential BugTrap reports posted on my Newton 
server from my most current errors. All three errors happens right after 
one another. Let me know if I need to adjust the frame size value to 
capture more data or not.

Of course, if my server is down it may be difficult to see these reports.

More reports.

First of all, the three reports I pointed to in my previous message have 
different urls now, because I stupidly moved them from the internal store 
to my card. Here are the new links:

     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$28.nsd
     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$29.nsd
     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$30.nsd

The next couple of errors were the result of closing the nHTTP prefs 
window after modifying the MOTD text field and applying the changes. This 
is similar to how the original errors I mentioned were triggered.

     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$25.nsd
     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$26.nsd

I then tried to access the server via my browser and generated one more:

     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$27.nsd

I rebooted the Newton manually after this since NPDS was no longer 
responding and the NPDS Watcher was evidently no longer running.

Thanks, Grant, this is very useful.

Big fixed in 2 mins (thanks to the log, of course). It was that when 
the port was 80, the title wasn't set. I'm going to upload the 2.039 
in a second. BTW, this bug exists since 2.036.

I guess this one is linked to the previous one. And the -8007 may be 
linked to the first bug, as when a bug occurs, the initialization 
process is stopped. And here, your -8007 is typically that the stop 
button wasn't initialized properly.
We'll see if you still experience it with the first bug fixed.

Same as bug 30. Confirms that both are linked.

Unfortunately, BugTrap didn't provide much data here. It hasn't 
disassembled InputScript function. So it took me an additionnal 5 
mins. Anyway, this is the well known bug with the non thread safe 
global variables. I'm sorry to say that I won't fix it now because it 
requires to rewrite the whole kernel of the server.

Thanks again for these bug reports. It really helps.

At restart, the Newton is registered on the server. If you were 
previously registered (basically if you were serving pages, you 
probably were), then you get this error message.

Heh. OK, done. 2.035 now lets you disable every 4xx error messages 
from the server.

BTW, I've uploaded it with nHTTPd 2.039.

Heh. Now that's what I call responsive customer service. It pays to talk

I'm loading up the new versions right now.

Hey Grant and Paul,

These were the exact errors I received as well.

Paul, I'll be sending you my logs as well as soon as I get the stuff installed.
Even thought It will probably turn out the same results, I guess it won't hurt any.

Actually, I prefer that you test the latest release (2.039). The goal 
is not to show that the 2.038 is unstable, it's to make the 2.039 as 
stable as possible.

Subject: [NPDS] Referencing External Style Sheet
Date: Fri, 24 Aug 2001 13:19:30 -0600
From: "Grant [Voxel Mapping] Hutchinson" <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Here's a thought.

After struggling to edit my custom style sheet using the NPDS Setup text 
editor, I thought of a better solution. You could get rid of the editor 
by using an external .css file stored in the same folder as the default 
index.html document that NoteServ uses. This would require a modification 
NoteServ so that it does not serve up .css-based notes.

A default .css document still be stored by NPDS in case you need to 
revert to the "factory" settings, but you could always edit the style 
sheet easily within the Notepad rather than via the rather limiting CSS 
editor.

I've found that my current style sheet is too large for the editor 
anyway, and that the editor will not scroll to the end of the document. I 
have to copy and paste it from the Notepad anyway.

Comments?

Actually, I thought about something different. We could have NPDS 
serving the .css page and have therefore an external css. The problem 
is that if it doesn't find some clues that it's an html document, 
NPDS adds plenty of stuff (such as the title of the note and so on) 
which we don't want for .css style sheets.

Having an internal .css was required because NPDS wasn't able to 
serve two documents at the same time. Now it is (with all the 
problems we know because I've just hacked the code to do that).

So what do you think? Anyone to convince me to keep an embedded .css?

But even with an external .css file, NPDS doesn't really serve two files 
at the same time. It only needs to reference the .css file (like it does 
for the internal one) for insertion into the various .html files that get 
served.

Isn't this correct?

Er... I think the situation right now is that NPDS embeds the CSS into the
header (<HEAD> ... </HEAD>) of every HTML document it serves.  I think
what Paul is saying is that NPDS can now server the CSS at a URL and
merely embed a link to it in all HTML pages.  Right?

I like the self-contained nature of it, simply because I don't really have a
box sitting somewhere where I would keep an .css, and also because it
provides a true portability.  I can take my Newton and NPDS anywhere in the
world, and so long as I can get on an ethernet network or dial up on an
analog phone line I could be running a self-contained web server.  There is
something extremely geeky about that.

But this is not to say that there shouldn't be a way to externally reference
a .css.  But I would like the embedded .css to stay because it very much
suits my needs for NPDS.

Thanks,

Josh Burker

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Referencing External Style Sheet

I think if NPDS is capable of serving two files at once, then you should 
definitely make serving the CSS as a separate file the default option. 
This is much more in line with the HTML 4.0 standard of separating content 
and display information. Honestly, the only reason I chose to embed the 
style sheet in all pages was that NPDS was limited to serving a single 
page at a time, so I chose the path of compromise.

Might I suggest that you add support (I can't remember if nHTTPd sends 
this header correctly or not) for sending a last-modified header. Then, 
send a constant last-modified time for the style sheet. Browsers that 
exhibit proper cacheing behavior will then only retrieve the style sheet 
once, the first time it is requested. All other requests for it will be 
served from the browser's cache.

As for the modification of NPDS to avoid HTML-izing the CSS files, all you 
have to change is the code section in NoteServ that looks first to the 
title for *.html. Add in code to catch *.css as well and you'll be set. 
You'll also want to modify the routines that generate lists of servable 
notes for display (the code that spits out HTML to replace, for instance, 
the NOTE_LIST server side include) to ignore notes with *.css in their 
titles.

Yes, and also avoid notes posted by users for this purpose and change 
the MIME type to send this information.

As soon as I have some time, I'm going to write it, unless someone 
else wants to do it, it's open source after all.

I think that's what I tried to say in the first place. I was confused 
because I wasn't thinking in terms of the style sheet getting _served_ by 
NPDS, only referenced by the other HTML documents. It's clear now.

Thanks guys.

Hi Josh.

An external .css file doesn't have to be on another box or another 
server. The style sheet would exist in the same NotePad folder along side 
the other notes and the main index.html file that NPDS uses. Therefore, 
it would be self-contained on your Newton, but not self-contained within 
the NPDS editing environment anymore.

From: "Grant [Voxel Mapping] Hutchinson" <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

I've been able to consistently reproduce a problem in nHTTPd 2.039 and it 
goes like this... 

With nHTTPd open and front most, I launch another program such as 
NotePad. nHTTP still appears in front of NotePad. I then select nHTTPd 
from either the Dashboard menu or directly in the Extras drawer, nHTTPd 
is now minimized. I try to maximize nHTTPd again using either the 
mini-button in Avi's (after closing NotePad) or by selecting it from the 
Dashboard menu or the Extras drawer. At this point BugTrap kicks in.

The first three reports linked below were generated by hitting the nHTTPd 
mini-button in Avi's, and the second three reports were generated by 
selecting nHTTPd from the Extras drawer:

     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$44.nsd
     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$45.nsd

     http://newton.splorp.com/html/-72365934$65.nsd

BugTrap also spat out one more report regarding something that happened 
to NPDS Watcher. I'm not sure how this error occurred, but you can take 
look at it anyway.

Date: Tue, 28 Aug 2001 12:18:37 -0400

Thanks Paul, some nice new fixes to this version. At last my nHTTPd doesn't
permanently say "Not Connected" when it really is!
-----
I recently had a -10061 which I triggered by tapping the nHTTPd's Plug-in
drop down. I recovered from the -10061 with ABD's i button, but after that,
the drop down would not respond (it recognized the tap, but no drop-down
appeared). Server was still active and responsive to queries.
-----
On its first ping by the tracker, I got a -48200 from the Watcher, which did
generate a Bug Trap Report, http://128.150.4.33/html/-88186101$411.nsd 
----
I still get restarts without a subsequent connection to the network - I was
able to observe one after a -64900 (?) Internet Error, which results in the
following floaters: 
- "Tracker Client: Oops, the server returned an error: [blank]"
- "Tracker Client: An error occurred in Endpoint Connect. A communications
problem occurred, Connection may have been dropped. Error = -16013"

The work-around to this is a simple Stop-Start recycle, but NPDS Watcher
will not do this by itself, so if there is no Admin around, the server stays
in this state indefinitely.

I had originally thought this was a card vs. internal problem, but two
things weigh against that - 1. it does not seem to matter whether I have all
pkgs. on internal or card, and 2. it does not happen on every restart.

As far as having some pkgs. on internal vs. some on card, I have tried to
make sure that my Farallon drivers load first (i.e. all NIE etc. on
internal), and then load NPDS stuff second (i.e. all NPDS on card), but this
behavior continues.

Perhaps it is a hiccup from the LAN, and so there is nothing NPDS can do
about it?

A listing of the current and supported modules can be found on a new 
server set up by Paul specifically to contain all the NPDS code:

     http://npds.free.fr/

To get up to speed on  what has been happening in the world of NPDS, I 
suggest you read this document:

NPDS Watcher (a lovely piece of software, I might add...) can be 
downloaded directly from here:

     http://npds.free.fr/NPDS%20Watcher/

The most currently version is "008ac".

Subject: [NPDS] How to prevent hanging

Hi,

I am running NPDS 2.039 (as http://paleonews.dartmouth.edu) and have a problem
when a connection apparently stays open, causing the server to hang. A restart
will get it going again. This also happened with earlier versions. Is there a
setting that will prevent this, or some other way to keep the server up and
running? The error message on NPDS is often 404 (Code Red virus ).

Grant:
Thanks for the leads and suggestions. I have pulled in the latest 
versions of each module via this page but now seem to have connection 
problems. I'm using the same settings as far as I can tell (I didn't 
change anything) but my connections seem to be very limited and I am 
getting tracker error msgs that I never saw before. At some points, 
it seems that not all the modules are showing up in nHTTPd until I 
restart. Perhaps I just need a little more documentation to get the 
updated versions to be compatible again. I did have NPDS working well 
in the past.

Any thoughts on where to start?

Thanks,

Dale

>Any thoughts on where to start?

Reboot after installation.
Then configure the tracker client. You were registered with a private 
IP (I unregistered you). Then check the configuration of all other 
modules. Some configurations have been lost in the upgrade process 
(such as the tracker client configuration for example).

The tracker client error messages are in fact errors from the server. 
Normally, you shouldn't see any, but if, for example, the tracker is 
down or you are trying to register again while you were already 
registered and so on, you get an error message. To avoid 400 error 
messages, just uncheck the proper box in the tracker client. You'll 
still be warned it if the tracker server is down.

Then press start. Enjoy.

NPDS Watcher does this. Grab the most recent version from the NPDS 
updates website (http://ndps.free.fr).
If by hanging you mean that your Newton is frozen, be sure to check 
the checkbox "Check that the NS task is alive" in the NPDS Watcher 
settings.

I think we might consider now that 2.039 is the officially supported 
nHTTPd version. It seems to be more stable than 2.037.

-10061 are really bad for NPDS because it works asynchronously. If 
you have one, you'd better reset.

BTW, I haven't had -10061 since I got this new unit (of course, it's 
a 2100). I'm running Heaven or Hell checking something like every 2-5 
mins plus power off checks and System Patch 0.5b with the super 
-10061 fix with a frequency of 500 (ms/pkg).

Got it. I'm going to fix this ASAP. Besides, this generates an 
exception in the verification process, hence the watcher didn't 
restarted the Newton.

Probably because Matt's tracker was down. I noticed that the error 
message isn't really clear. I got the same this morning.

Well, when I got such errors, my Newton continued to serve pages.
Generally, tracker client errors do not affect the server itself. 
Hence the fact that NPDS Watcher doesn't restart the Newton in such a 
case.

>Perhaps it is a hiccup from the LAN

Yes, perhaps.

I'm sure that your Newton still was serving pages properly. Could you 
please check the next time you get the problem?

more stable versions around.

Oh, a special note to Grant and Paul. Could you please not publish

Not a problem. The offending (yet once useful) logs have been summarily 
dismissed from the home page. Poof!

Paul - is there any way to serve up a note out of the soup that doesn't

OK Paul -- I deleted all BugTrap Report previous to the latest install, and
also moved the link to the NPDS Bugs to a more obscure place in my tree. (I
didn't want to remove it entirely, since I can never remember the URL
anyway).

BTW, do you have any idea where BugTrap is getting its Time/Date information
from?  It generates one Time/Date for the title of the note, and has another
Time/Date in the text of the note, which are different from each other, and
BOTH WRONG when compared to the Clock app. The incorrect Time/Date in note
title also shows up in the second line of the Notes Overview (I am not sure
whether this coming from the created or modified slot)

...OK, I suspect the Time/Date in the text is the "Created" Time/Date _for
the pkg that crashed_ and not the note itself. That's one of them solved,
but the title Date/Time is still different by three hours from the Clock.

Very odd, and makes me wonder whether to trust the sorting of these notes by
date!  I realize you have nothing to do w/ BugTrap, but just a word before
you rely on the title Time/Dates for anything...

I just saw I was not registered on Matt's tracker, so I tapped the pull-down
for plug-ins, and --- hey! no Tracker Client listed!  Only four of the
plug-ins were listed (and I forgot to note which four...)
Stop-start did no good. 
Close-launch did no good. 
Only solution was a reboot to get back the full list of eight.

I wish CodeRed would get stamped out sometime soon...

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS modules disappear from plug-ins menu?
Date: Fri, 31 Aug 2001 11:42:22 -0600
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Hey gang, here's a bug.

I don't want people poking around my calendar or contacts. Even with the 
SSI tags removed from the home page, there are links to them on the 404 
page, so I deactivated the DateServ and CardServ modules by unchecking 
the "Active" box in Prefs. After doing this, the modules disappeared from 
the NPDS plug-ins menu and I cannot seem to reactivate them. Even after a 
reboot, these two modules do not appear in the menu. I haven't tried to 
reinstall them yet. 

I'm running the latest versions of everything.

Any suggestions?

Go to Extras and tap on the modules.  Their prefs slips will appear.
Re-activate them and then they will be back in the NPDS plugins menu.

Have you tried to tap on their icons in Extras and reactivate them from
there (by checking the appropriate boxes)?

On another note:  I had success today with one admin-post, but now I get a
404 for all subsequent attempts... Dang! I thought I finally found a good
way to get stuff from my desktop into my server without e-mail or NCU -1
errors...

Doh.

Just a thought... wouldn't it make sense to have the modules stay in the 
plug-in menu even when they're not active? It would be slightly more 
convenient and slightly less confusing (at least for people like me...)

Thanks Victor.

Yes and no. When I implemented the plug-in architecture, I wanted there to 
be NO possibility that you could accidentally leave a module active that 
you didn't want to be active. So, the plugin menu reflects only plug-ins 
that are installed and active.. it's a quick way to check which plugins 
are active as well as a shortcut to opening them and modifying their 
preferences.

It chokes on large amounts of text, so you have to break up the post into
pieces (even with Bigger Notes installed, so the limitation is probably in
NPDS somewhere).

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Admin post problem solved

Unless Paul has implemented POST in nHTTPd, NPDS is limited to less than 
1K of text because that's the limit of a GET request (actually, it's 255 
characters but you're allowed to cheat and go to 1024). Even then, I think 
BiggerNotes is a hack that stores note data in another slot of the Notes 
frame. If I remember right, I wrote NoteServ to use the NewtonOS API call 
to create a Note rather than writing directly to the Notes soup. To 
implement BiggerNotes support, someone needs to find out what slot 
BiggerNotes stores its data in, then patch NoteServ so that if BiggerNotes 
is installed, it writes directly to that slot instead of using the 
built-in method for creating a note.

Yes, I am extra-active on the NPDS list today. I am up to my butt in 
corrections to my thesis and so responding to NPDS mailings is looking 
pretty attractive...

When it's explained that way, it makes much more sense. I guess I'm just 
a finicky guy when it comes to UI consistency. I realize there are many 
more issues and features in NPDS that take priority, but another option 
would be to grey out those particular items in the menu so they don't 
disappear - or flag the ones that _are_ active with bullets.

Thanks much for the explanation Matt.

Like you Grant, I find this annoying (I'm deactivating the tracker 
client all at least twice per day to change my connection method, and 
to avoid to have to go to the extras drawer, I call the tracker, then 
the backdrop button twice to put the server to the front, then I 
uncheck register with a tracker, I press stop, star, internet 
connection, yes, wait a second, start, register with a tracker). But 
now that I think about it, Matt's reason is a good reason. I'll have 
to define another GUI which does make it clear which module is active 
and which isn't while it will also show all the present modules.

Actually, NPDS accepts 8 KB of data including headers. It's the way 
it's written. The limitation is more likely to be in the browsers.

No. It's just setting the max size slot of the Notes application to 
32 KB (instead of 8 KB), so alerts are gone. I think here it's KB and 
not K-Characters.

Grant, there is now two note pad folders, and the behavior is a 
little bit different from the one in the NPDS 2.0 documentation. It's 
not particularly clear, and I think that Josh wrote a good note about 
it.

Oh, his Newton is up right now.

Ah, yes. That clears it up. I seem to remember reading this note way, way 
back in time, but it didn't click with me until now. All the more reason 
to have a team start revamping the NPDS docs to include all of these 
third-party tips and other addenda.

Or is documentation on your to-do list as well Paul? :)

Bah, it would be great if I was helped in this task. It's great to 
see that Adam started to work on NPDS so I don't feel like the only 
developer for this branch of NPDS for the Newton modules (the tracker 
server is mainly Victor's project). Curiously, I got plenty of mails 
of people asking if they could help me for the ATA project once I did 
most of the analyzing work and nothing for NPDS :-)

However, I think that I'm going soon to work on the 3.0 server & 
modules. So I don't want to waste your time with writing 
documentation for things that will surely change (like this folders 
thing).

Man, if I knew my way around NTK better, I'd be all over NPDS... I guess

Good call. I will be first in line (after Josh of course...) to be part 
of the team to work on the 3.0 documentation. I just love making screen

I'm crashing every hour or so, and the Watcher does its job on reboot, but
my Farallon cord's LED nearly always goes out right during the "Engaging the
Ethernet Driver" dialog. Is there a 'toggle' somewhere in this routine that
simply changes state instead of checking to see whether there is the right
condition for proceeding? I'm tired of the Stop->Start routine all day, and
barely surviving a single verification interval from the Trackers.

Other fun, to stop my moaning.

No. However, what you describe is a timing problem with your driver, 
and it could easily be fixed by making a little change in the watcher.

But first, what is the state of the check box "Start up NPDS after 5 
seconds" in the watcher's prefs? and what happens if you toggle it?

Hi folks,

There is a new version of NPDS Watcher available on the updates websites.
http://npds.free.fr/NPDS%20Watcher/

Changes:
--------

Fixed the bug experienced by Paul Filmer (411, 440 & 441):
	Now, if the endpoint's disposal function fails, we gonna restart.
Fixed the bug experienced by Grant Hutchinson (53):
	Now, if the endpoint's bind fails, we gonna restart.
The checking interval pickers now shows the actual strings instead
	of the number of seconds when the prefs are open.
Fixed the bug experienced by Alex Humffray (4/9/01 7:30, 5/9/01 2:51)
	The state of the button and the status line isn't updated if they're
	not visible (it will be updated when they'll show up).

A couple of notes on this new version & on NPDS Watcher in general:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't tested this version at all, I just have compiled it and 
installed it 6 minutes ago (at 1146) according to PkgInfo. So beware, 
as usual (but if you don't test it, nobody else will ;).

Paul you mentionned you had a lot of reboots recently. When 
discussing with Alex I discovered that the default checking interface 
(10 secs) isn't too low (for the NS Task Checking).

Let me explain things again.
We have two separated checking tasks in NPDS Watcher. One checks that 
there is no error message from the server indicating that it's no 
longer serving (don't dismiss these error messages) and it's also 
checking that the Newton is still listening on the port it's supposed 
to listen on.
The way this last test is done is simply that the watcher tries to 
listen on the same port. If the system doesn't report that his 
request cannot be fulfilled because someone else is listening on that 
port, the watcher considers that things are ok. This error must be 
reported within 3 checking intervals. If no error is reported, the 
Watcher reboots. This is important because all these operations are 
async, and the server can be stolen the port by the watcher (hence 
having checks done not too frequently is a good idea). If this 
happens, the watcher will of course reboot the Newton, but it is 
responsible for the fact that the server went down.
When a server error dialog pops out or when the watcher detects that 
the Newton is no longer listening on the port it should be listening 
on, the watcher starts the count-down reboot (with the buzzer sound).

The other checks is nearly totally independant from the previous one. 
It's a check that the NewtonScript task is alive. In fact, it's a 
check that the NewtonScript task went idle often enough. If you do 
some lengthy operation with your Newton, the NewtonScript task won't 
go idle and the NS Task Check will think that the NewtonScript task 
crashed. Therefore, it will reboot. Since the count-down reboot 
requires the NewtonScript task to be alive, here we have a silent 
reboot. The NewtonScript task should go idle at least once per 4 * 
the checking interval in average.

Therefore, if you're experiencing too many silent reboots especially 
when you were doing something (Alex was retrieving usenet messages), 
increase the checking interval. You can also simply disable the NS 
Task Check. Please note that I didn't implement this only for the 
technologiedemonstration but also because I got some NS Task crashes 
which of course locked the server.

The known bugs left:
--------------------

As you all know, there is a big problem with NPDS not being thread 
safe and the hack I wrote to support multiple connections. That's 
actually why the NPDS watcher is there :-/

I consider Paul Filmer's 428 bug report to be caused by this (among 
other things).

I'm going to work on Grant's 44/45 & 63/64, although it might be a 
problem with his prefs. And I'll see if 46 & 65 aren't linked with 
that. But first, I have a bug to fix in ATA Support (among others) 
which made that my Newton stopped serving web pages at 0327 because 
the linear cards wasn't recognized as such.

First off, I must say that my Newton server never gets near as much traffic
as Paul F.'s or Paul G.'s, but I do have to say that my NPDS setup has been
particularly stable.

I'm running everything current and generally have few problems.

I do find that every now and then the GIF Server gets munged up; usually
this is associated with a crash of the GIF server as it serves a page.  I
usually hear the "shutter" sound of the screen capture, then the Newton
reboots.  Subsequent reboots and startups of NPDS, followed by a screen
capture, would also crash the Newton.  I found that manually deleting the
NPDS Storage from the Newton's storage would be what got it going again.

NoteServ has been very stable for me.  However, after a crash I will go into
the NoteServ plugin and flush the cache.

But as I prefaced, my Newton doesn't see the traffic that others' do.

Weird, I thought this was fixed with 009ac. I'll look deeper into that.

The -48809 you have here seems to be the one I used to have sometimes 
when pressing the UP button in the tracker client. I admit that I 
should have fixed it, but since I never got it on restarts, it wasn't 
annoying enough to make me spend time on it ;)

BTW, folks, these will probably be the last bugs I'll fix in NPDS 2.x.

I guess you're running the watcher. What's the checking interval? I'm 
sure it's too low. Set it to 1 or better 5 mins. I think that it 
should fix the problem.

Here's the story (again). The Watcher checks that the NS tasks goes 
idle often enough, and when you're processing a screen shot, it takes 
too long, and the Watcher's NS Task Checker thinks that the NS Task 
crashed (while it's just particularly busy serving the screen shot).

It can also be a problem of not enough free space on your Newton. How 
much free space do you have on the various mounted stores?

However, Alex experienced the problem you described and setting the 
checking interval to a higher value solved it.

This probably occurred because you were already registered to the 
server. Therefore it returned a "400 Bad request error" message when 
you sent a register command. This is what Matt's tracker does. 
Victor's tracker say "400 Host is already registered" or something 
like this.
If you don't want to see 400 messages from the server, just uncheck 
the corresponding check box in the prefs (this feature was added in 
Tracker Client 2.035).

Sometimes, the tracker server is unreachable. There is an interface 
bug in the tracker client, in that case, you get : "Oops, the server 
returned an error:" without anything else. If it's the case, check 
your internet connection and/or gateway settings. It can also be that 
the server is down. Try Victor's tracker which seems to be more 
stable.

It appears that Matt's tracker isn't accepting registrations again. I've 
been getting communication and "connection dropped" errors all day. Since 
Victor hasn't chimed in yet, I'll step in, tip my hat, and mention the 
fact that his Java tracker is still running very nicely at the moment.

Here are the Tracker Client settings for Victor's server:

   Server:   misato.chuma.org (or 24.157.128.19)
     Path:   (leave blank)
HTTP Port:   80

Don't forget to save your prefs after changing trackers.

You guys had better migrate to Victor's tracker pretty soon anyway. I won'
t be at U of I much longer and can't guarantee how long the old tracker 
will be left up. Maybe a long time, maybe a few days after I leave someone 
will shut it down for good.

The next version of the tracker client that comes out should set misato as 
the default tracker, if it doesn't already.

Cheers,

Matt

Thanks for the heads up Matt.

Victor, I'm still willing to run another copy of the Java tracker on the 
newted.dyndns.org box, but I'll probably need a bit of remote admin help 
from you to get it set up properly. I can't remember whether you and Paul 
got the Share & Query protocol worked out or not. If there is more than 
one Java tracker running, do they talk to each other?

By the way, I noticed that I typed the wrong port number for the Tracker 
client settings in my last email. This is the correct version:

   Server:   misato.chuma.org (or 24.157.128.19)
     Path:   (leave blank)
HTTP Port:   2110

What a dumb bunny.

Yes, if you tell them about each other.  This has been tested a little
bit.  That would be great, Grant.

Are you sure there's a JDK for Linux/MIPS?  I can give you a hand, just
gimme a ring (metaphorically).

I think this is what we'll need, although the documentation says it will 
only run on a RaQ3, RaQ4, or Qube3.

No, that's for serving JSP (Java Server Pages) and the like.  If you reset
my password to newted and mail it to me :) I'll log in and see what's

Speaking of JDK for MIPS, I did find a mention of the following in the 
Cobalt Knowledgebase:

Subject: [NPDS] Binary Server experiments


I have already sent an email to Paul Guyot about this, but thought I
would share my experiments with this list.

If anyone has any advise or experience please chime in!

Here is what was said:
-----------------------------------------
To: Paul
From: John

---------------------------------
Once again Paul,
I realize that you are a busy man, and I am not a paying customer asking

for technical support.
Don't consider me to be a high priority. I don't mind to wait.
---------------------------------

I am still playing with Binary Server and trying to add a third .gif
file to the Binaries@Binary storage.

I can install a third .gif file, and it shows that there are three items

in the Binaries@Binary store.
I can access the other 2 images with a web browser.
When you try to access the third image with a web browser, the server
gives the response

"Internal Server Error
This server has encountered an internal error preventing it from
fulfilling your request"

I have rechecked everything, rebuilt the package and even restarted from

scratch from the raw .gif image.


I think my problem might be in creating the resource file. You mentioned

to me before that ResEdit has a limitation size of 32000.

Do you mean that using ResEdit, the resource file can be no bigger than
this  -or- you can not copy more than 32000 into a fork at one time?


Another question I was wondering about was the other "ZIP" resource in
the "serve-npds" auto-remove package.

What does this resource do?
Do I need this resource to make each additional package?


Thanks for your time in advance.

No idea, I should look in the code if ever there is a limit. I think 
that the only limit is that the whole thing is more or less in the 
NewtonScript heap.

FYI, there is no big difference with sering GIFs which can be around 30 KB.
Limits for the size of data that NPDS can send are usually the 
latency, the firewalls & other nice things like this.

There is a 8 KB limit for the data it can get (in forms) which is, I 
think, higher than the normal GET command limit.

Indeed, but when I recompile a big project because I changed debug 
options in order to fix a bug, I have some time to reply to e-mails 
or to drink coffee.

>I am still playing with Binary Server and trying to add a third .gif
>file to the Binaries@Binary storage.

The problem with your two GIFs is that NPDS can't handle that many 
requests at the same time. This may be solved in the future with 
experiments I've done yesterday. I'm currently able to have native 
(i.e. not involving NewtonScript) async communications, and I can 
spawn a task to process the comm (useful to process the HTTP 
requests, NewtonScript will be required anyway at a moment because 
there is no other way to access the stores - however, some modules 
such as a new GIF Server and 404 could be handled entirely natively).

>I can access the other 2 images with a web browser.

It basically means that an exception occurred while processing the 
request. Try to install bugtrap and tell it to catch exception inside 
a try/catch, and send me the report.

>I think my problem might be in creating the resource file.

I don't think so. Binary Server will serve anything provided that 
it's properly saved in your soup. Do you have a soup editor? Are 
there exactly the same slots in this 3rd item than in the two others?
It's true that Binary Server doesn't check for the existence of the 
slots. Maybe a slot is missing and it generated an exception and 
hence the error.

>Do you mean that using ResEdit, the resource file can be no bigger than
>this  -or- you can not copy more than 32000 into a fork at one time?

You cannot copy/paste more than 30000 bytes in a resource. Of course, 
you can have much larger resources/resource files.

>What does this resource do?

It's probably an old NPDS package I used to serve from my Newton, zipped.

>Do I need this resource to make each additional package?

No.

What is the trick to having your Tracker Client automatically register
with Matt's AND Victor's Tracker servers?

I can't find any option to in version 2.035........

It's done manually at the moment, although there do exist options on the
tracker end for checking each other.  Nothing automatic within NPDS itself
at the moment.

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Tracker client trick?

The reason there's no way to do in under NPDS is that the guys who run 
trackers are supposed to set up sharing of server lists between themselves.
  The Tracker protocol makes specific provisions for this sharing and as 
far as I know, Victor's tracker DOES support it. Mine, however, does not. 
If we can get two Java trackers running (for redundancy) then servers 
listed on one should be listed on the other.

Register on a tracker (or two).

Wait for the tracker to come by an click you, verify that the icon has
changed to an MP with the "T" in the screen.

Minimize to the star.

Reopen - observe that the icon shows that you are no longer tracked (even
though you are listed on the tracker).

Similarly, the drop down of hosts will often show "No New Hosts" when it had
previously shown a list before minimization.

Preferred behaviour for the drop down: Simply list the last 5 - 10 - 15
(option?) hosts, regardless of resets.

Indeed. Victor has been doing tests, and the sharing commands he 
implemented works pretty well. Apparently, he's been working on 
newted, so we may have two trackers up soon.

The client doesn't support double registration because it's not worth 
the effort as Matt's tracker is up for a limited time. Besides, it 
has several bugs in it, it's not open source (and even if it was, it 
has been written in REALBasic which only Matt has and knows) so we 
can't fix them (anyway, apparently problems such as the DNS caching 
thing seem to come from REALBasic runtime). Therefore the only 
supported tracker server is the Java one (there was the same painful 
DNS caching problem in the runtime, but Victor fixed it by installing 
Java 1.2).

Newted is not going to be running a Java Runtime anytime soon.

And NewtonTalk is down, yes I know...

Wow, I ignored this feature of NPDS. I probably broke it with my 
various hacks :-/

I'm open to suggestions here for NPDS 3.0.

As I wrote, I won't fix any bug but maybe the exception thing in the 
watcher (but Paul, do you have BugTrap to log exceptions inside Try 
Catch? if so, please change this setting to ignore them) and the UP 
button in the tracker client.

I prefer not to talk about the advancement of NPDS 3.0, but I really 
want to change my Newton website, and NPDS 2.x doesn't support well 
more than one picture on a page (cf John's home page), if you see 
what I mean - also, Grant will bug me if I don't release a native 
HTTP client soon :) - to be used in the WebPager 3.0 among others.

How about recognizing Mozilla/Netscape 6 as a valid browser to send CSS

Is this because there isn't a reliable JDK that will run on MIPS? Did you

that elusive rack-mount OS X server aren't I?

I have taken my Newt offline due to repeated attacks that generate 30 to 40

Precisely because of this type of activity I have switched my NPDS server to

I've been getting a steady trickle of Code Red hits, but nothing like 
they've been describing on /. We could be in for a worse bout of attacks 
vased on what I read on that thread.

Nice timing, eh?

>>I suppose I could just freeze BugTrap, but that's not the point
>>of it all is it?

Personally, I'd rather disable BugTrap for the time being and have a more 
stable server than go through the hassle of changing over ports again. It 
would probably be a different story if I was using a dynamic DNS service 
- then it wouldn't be as big an issue. But since I'm using a fixed static 
IP and have just started telling people about the URL, I'd hate to have 
to go back and star over again. Fortunately, this too shall pass.

>I'm sorry that NPDS isn't strong enough to face those attacks.

Paul, every day I'm happy when I realize that my Newton can run a web 
server in the first place. :)

Yeah, I just saw this too.  Just what we all need.

I've been running on port 8080 since Code Red.  It almost makes sense in the
post-Code Red days to run NPDS servers on port 8080; they are less likely to
be hit in an attack like this.  Most people are getting to the Newtons from
the trackers anyhow, so it shouldn't be too hard to redirect people to the
site on port 8080.  Here's how to configure NPDS to serve on port 8080:

To set your Newton up to serve on port 8080, go into the NPDS Setup package,
and then tap on the Security tab.  Under the TCP/IP prefs, you can set it to
port 8080.

Back in the Tracker Client leave the "Newton is in a LAN (behind a gateway)"
checked.  The Public IP address should be your IP address, without the port;
mine is 123.45.67.8 for example.  Everything else in the Tracker Client has
nothing to do with your server, per se; leave the misato or Matt's tracker
settings alone.  The ports you see in the Tracker Client refer to the ports
on the Tracker servers:  port 2110 for misato, port 80 for Matt's tracker.

HTH,

Josh Burker

Ok, I caved in. I changed NPDS over to 8080 and things seem to be happier 
now. It's just a pain in the collective rumpus that we have to keep 
adapting and reconfiguring our own systems because Microsoft can't seem 
to keep the barn door closed.

Oh well.

It's funny too because the patch that will fix this was available in August from
Microsoft.

(See CERT info at http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-26.html )

You'd think that Microsoft could adopt something like Apple has with the Automatic
Software Update feature of Mac OS 9.

Pretty tricky virus/worn they got there. I just patched my companies computers tonight.

John,

I'm not a Windows guy, but I do take care of a couple of Win98 rigs in my 
lab, and they both have a service called Windows Update, which will check 
with Macrosoft for what they call "Critical Updates", then give you the 
option to download them. Of course, the while thing is not nearly as good 
as Software Update under OS9/OSX, but it's there, at least under 98. Does 
NT or 2000 have a similar feature? I don't remember seeing it under NT4 
SP6, but maybe I missed it.

Yes. I am aware of this feature.
The windows updates via the web site http"//windowsupdate.microsoft.com are available for
all windows operating systems, 98, NT, ME, 2K, and I'm sure XP.

The difference is, Mac can auto-update (if you choose) and Windows machines have to be
done manually. AND, Not all security updates/service packs are available through the
windows update site.

I have put every setting for all of my plug-ins and other relevant packages

Hope they help, otherwise its the successively more painful ladder for you:

- re-load all plug-ins
- re-load NPDS

I can let you know that I've been seeing some of the same things you

clear things out. I'm not even sure of that really as I haven't had a

Actually, I never had this until I read your message (I'm not 
kidding). I've been indeed experiencing this yesterday night when 
fighting with the DHCP server because apparently my ISP has changed 
something and my Newton can't get an address as soon as the mac went 
off.

Does anyone know of a way to change the default sort order of the notes

to most recent, I's like to have most recent note to least recent?

I know of a way to do it using a very convoluted (read: clunky)

handier) preference.

Thought? Or is this on the 3.0 wish list already?

This is possible. The latest version (2.042) lets you specify both a root 
or default folder for the index.html and other notes created by you, and 
a folder specifically for the notes posted using the whiteboard via the 
server itself. You set these folders using the two pickers in the 
NoteServ window.

Thanks Grant.

That's what I've been trying to do. I wonder if I have to clear out a

in one folder (selected) and then another set up for the various NPDS 
postings I've received over time. I haven't been able to get the two

hmmm.

Here's a page on my NPDS server about how to set up the two different Notes
folders:

http://24/255/52/100:8080/html/NoteServ%20Configuration

However, I am unsure how to change the sort order of particular notes.

Josh, methinks you slipped on your keyboard and accidentally typed 
slashes instead of dots in your IP address. :)

Dale, you got sent to 24.com instead of Josh's server because your 
browser read the first bit of the original link as "http://24/" which was 
translated to "http://24.com/". By the way, 24.com appears to be a 
domain-squatter's referral portal, hence all of the links.

Dale, try this url instead:

http://24.255.52.100:8080/html/NoteServ%20Configuration

If Josh's server is up and running, the information there will be very 
helpful.

Hi folks,

I've just fixed the bug which sometimes threw a -48809 exception when 
opening the server application.

This bug has been reported by Alex Humffray (4/09/01, 7:31 +1000) and 
John Skinner (21/09/01, 2:04 -0500).

You'll find the new version on the website for this branch of NPDS:

Thanks for the update Paul.

However, and I know it's just a little thing, but the version number in 
the about window still read 1.0a9 not 1.0a10. I tried recompiling the 
project with the correct value for kVersionStr but the inspector says 
there are several unknown global functions: GetRegisteredSound; 
InetReleaseLink; InetGrabLink; and InetReleaseLink.

I must be missing a library somewhere.

>Thanks for the update Paul.

Oh, I have no merit at all, I've been experiencing this bug a lot 
lately, so I had to fix it. Yeah, I said that I was working on NPDS 
3.0 but it's not serving anything yet, so I am still using NPDS 2.x.

>However, and I know it's just a little thing, but the version number in

OK, I fixed this. If you did download the 010ac binary before this 
message and you care about that little thing, you can download the 
new 010ac package. The previous package did include the bug fix, it's 
just that I forgot to update the version number.

>I must be missing a library somewhere.

Actually, no, it's that the software calls global functions which are 
not declared and the project preferences are set to warn about use of 
undefined functions (which is useful to let you know about a possible 
missing colon in front of a method name). NTK builds the package 
nevertheless.

GetRegisteredSound isn't documented I think and InetGrabLink & 
InetReleaseLink are NIE global functions - yeah, we should check that 
these functions are present before doing anything, this is a dirty 
thing in NPDS I admit it, although usually people want to serve web 
pages after having an internet access on their Newton and therefore 
NIE installed. I fixed this by declaring the functions in a new file. 
This change is included in the new 010ac stuffit archive. It doesn't 
change anything to the binary.

Thanks for the report, Grant.

I had a 6 MB card that had a lot of data on it. I backed it up and
restored it to my new Pretec card.

Now all of my links from my NPDS home site to my notes (posted by me and

Anybody know how I can fix them?

From: Matt Vaughn <nospam_matt.vaughn_at_mindspring_dot_com>

John,

The first part of a hard-coded NoteServ link is a unique ID representing 
the card or other memory device the note is stored on. For a reference on 
the matter, see

"The NPDS Pseudo-Filename System: How To Be a Card-Based Computer in a 
Disk-Based World" at
http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearDesign/NPDS/Manuals/docs202/english/naming.
html

If you changed flash-cards, this ID will change, too. What you need to do 
is list the notes stored on the card, find the first part of the virtual 
filename, determine the ID of the new card, and replace all instances of 
the old ID with the new.

Here's an idea: use Script Editor to define to new SSI "STORAGE_CARD" that 
returns this new ID value, then construct your new URLS to read 
html/<STORAGE_CARD>$967.xxx . If you change cards again and have to repeat 
this exercise, you can simply change the value returned by the SSI.

Good luck,

Matt

Hi,

I have a problem installing the ScriptEditor-2.0.pkg at
http://npds.free.fr/npds/Utilities (or something like it...)

It seems to install right, but the installer hangs at the end. And I am
told that the NPDS-Scripts.pkg is not a package.

Could someone please zip these down and mail them to me?

And while I am at it, does anyone on the list have any experience with
TimeReporter for Newton? I wish for a TimeReporter module for NPDS. How
hard is that to make?

Best,

I am going crazy now!

My NPDS server will not allow any browser to connect! It returns a

I have done 2 complete brain wipes, and have only installed fresh new
packages from http://npds.free.fr/ of all the latest versions.

I did do a restore with NCU of ONLY the Notes which had my custom HTML
page.

I give up!
Anybody ever experienced this, or know how to fix it?


P.S. is it possible for the Newton to view it's own web site with a
local browser? (example: http://127.0.0.1)

When you did the brainwipe, you would have nuked all of the NPDS settings 
as well. Check the NPDS prefs under "Admin" and crank the "Latency" way 
down (I use a setting somewhere between 600 and 800). If I recall 
correctly, when I first started using NPDS, the default latency setting 
was way too high to properly handle local (same LAN) connections to the 
server.

Can anyone verify this?

Huh?

The latency has strictly no effect on the *first* connection to the 
server. It's the time to wait before closing the connection after the 
last byte has been sent.
The thing is that Matt didn't know how to find out when writing 
operation was completed (I'm not sure this can be done with NS 
Endpoints, but it's of course feasible with C++ endpoints), hence 
this latency.

Since you can't connect at all, this is probably a problem of port or 
of IP (you're not connecting to the proper IP) or of routing.

>I did do a restore with NCU of ONLY the Notes which had my custom HTML
>page.

This isn't involved at all. What you have is that your browser 
attempts to open a connection to a machine (let's say it's your 
Newton, i.e. the IP is correct) and this machine says: no, port is 
closed.

>P.S. is it possible for the Newton to view it's own web site with a
>local browser? (example: http://127.0.0.1)

I thought this wasn't possible until I realized that in fact, it's 
just 127.0.0.1 which doesn't work. If your Newton IP is X.Y.Z.T, 
http://X.Y.Z.T/ or http://X.Y.Z.T:port/ will work in NetHopper (not 
sure for Newtscape, but there is no reason that it wouldn't work).

Well I can ping it from any other computer on the network, so I know

Well I know my NPDS server is set to be serving on port 80
 
I just tried rebooting my newton, then starting up NPDS server again.

When I start the server after a reboot, I can connect to it from another
computer for about 1 sec.
Then all tries fail.

Any ideas?..

Of course you're correct Paul. Silly me. The latency setting was the 
first thing that sprang into my head when I read "Connection was refused 
by the server". Latency caused me no end of connection problems when I 
first started tinkering with NPDS.

I have never been able to get Newts cape to work this way. I always get 
"A communication problem occured..." messages.

I couldn't get NetHopper to display the web server either.

I have double checked all the settings: IP address, port number, cleared
the cache and rebooted and even made sure there were no soups from any
old setups of NPDS. I erased all my cards! And now I'm right back where
I was before I erased everything.

It isn't anything like,.. the NPDS packages have to all be on the
internal store...   or anything, huh?

I don't think it matters, but I will try anything at this point.

I guess I do a brian wipe and load a previous version back on and try it.

I don't have any solutions to offer but think Josh's lead is a good 
one. I find that I can keep my less loaded backup unit online longer 
too. I went through a spell like John describes and cleared up some 
space, kept checking all my settings, and somewhere in the process, I

Good luck!

WOW!

Thanks for all the help guys. I'm gonna try Josh's idea out right now
(3:10 AM).

I feel kinda silly. I had never read that part of the manual before. I
have read quite a bit on the other topics (not installation).

I'll post my results.

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] New tracker server

Hi all,

I've setup a new tracker server. And I set it to share with misato 
(and misato to share with it). It is hosted by Bill Shamam (who also 
hosts NTLK) at:
http://shakti.continuity.cx:2110

To register on it (instead of misato, you don't need to be registered 
on both as they share their records), just use misato settings but 
replace misato.chuma.org with shakti.continuity.cx.

Victor, I've noticed a couple of things while setting up the server on shakti:
a/ 1.27 on npds.free.fr doesn't compile (on shakti - JVM 1.2.1), in 
saveServers, we have synchronized { ... } instead of synchronized ( 
mHostInfoVector ) { ... }.
I fixed that.
b/ 1.27 on misato isn't 1.27 on npds.free.fr (it basically doesn't 
have synchronized { ... } at all which isn't a good idea and might 
explain why it crashed). Note: I'm probably guilty here.
c/ the tracker server outputted some stuff to the stderr. We probably 
don't want that.
d/ it refused to work without npdscmd.txt file created.
e/ even if both servers have shareEnabled set to 1 in the .ini file, 
from the admin console, they say that it is disabled (and indeed 
behave accordingly).
f/ I guess they don't save this shareEnabled setting. This isn't a 
problem if they take the .ini into account :)
g/ In npdscmd.txt, one can read for every shared record something like:
REGUP null:0 Paul Guyot's Experimental Newton Server
Not sure that things will be alright at restart. Also, we can't find 
the list of shared server. I think that for that, we need REGUPSERVER 
commands defined and implemented.
h/ the software accepts to have the same Newton as its own and as a 
shared one. I think this is a bad idea, but a good strategy would be 
rather complex.

I'll try to fix points c-e and maybe g/h.

Well, I tried Josh's sugestion from the manual and it did not change the outcome.

:(

I can't serve web pages anymore. Rats!

I can still surf the web with NetHopper though.

Other things I have tried:
Rename my HTML file something else, then get NoteServ to generate a new
default "index.html".
Didn't change.
Connect my Newton to only my Mac with a crossover cable, then try to
access the NPDS server.
Didn't change.

Now lets think logically here...
--------------------------------
The Newton will connect to other things via ethernet just fine
(NetHopper, Dock-to-NCU on Mac, and Register it's self on the
misato.chuma.org tracker)

The Newton will answer a request to it's NPDS server only once, right
when it first starts up (immeadiately After I see the connection slip
"Loading Ethernet Driver..." go away)

If I leave the NPDS server up and running, the Watcher app. will reboot
the Newton about every 15 Min. or so.

None of this makes any sence, because these packages work just fine on
other people's Newtons.

Back to square one!.....

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi everybody!

Well, I also had this problem a long time ago. I asked the list for help, 
but none of the good ideas helped. :-(

I was unable to use my spesific Newton for NPDS, all other Newtons 
(my co-mates) worked. A very fustrating situation.

About a year later I had a huge system crash, and I had to restore from an 
ancient backup. I found out that if I did not restore "System information" 
(or whatever it is called) NPDS would work again!

The first time this happened to me was when I upgraded from nHTTPD (OR 
some other httpd for Newton) to NPDS.
It also happened not to long ago when I upgraded from one version of NPDS 
to another.

I got tired of always have to provide the Newton with my name, location, 
writing recognition etc., so I bought another Newton where I could install 
NPDS and leave it online.

What you need to do is to backup your Newton.
Hold power button and reset button until you are asked if you wish to 
delete all information on the Newton. Delete.
Restore from backup. Do not restore "System Information" or anything else 
that is system-like. Do not restore NPDS or modules.
Install NPDS according to manual.
Say "Thanks" if it works.
Say "You stupid idiot wasted my time" if it doesn't. :-)

Shucks!

OK, grab a copy of Prefs Cleaner and follow these directions:

Remove all the packages.
2.	In your storage folder in the Extensions drawer, select NPDS =
Cache=20
and Delete all the items. This, as you can guess, will remove all your=20=

GIFs, cached HTML bits, and other large stored data structures.
3.	Next, tap NPDS Scripts and NPDS Log in the Storage drawer and=20
Delete those items. Those are CGI scripts and Log entries, respectively.
4.	To be complete, use a prefs-cleaner like *Standalone's Prefs=20
Cleaner to remove these entries from your Prefs soup.

=95 nHTTPd:ALLPEN
=95 pHTML:MAVON
=95 pDATES:MAVON
=95 pCARDS:MAVON
=95 HTTPConfig:MAVON
=95 pGIFS:MAVON
=95 pPAGER:MAVON
=95 NPDS:MAVON

Then reinstall nHTTPd and initialize it, then the other packages you=20
want to load.  It makes sense that it might be a preference left on the=20=

Newton at some point that is hanging up the server.  I can see your=20
Newton on misato and shakti (you have to love our Trackers' names,=20
btw).  There's just something that's screwing up the Notes being served=20=

(though I've also tried to pull up your /screen and your /dates as=20

This one is curious.

Additionally, clearing a bunch of packages that I didn't need off the=20
Newton and freezing others completely stablized my Newton=20

our Trackers' names, btw).  There's just something that's screwing up
the Notes being served (though I've also tried to pull up your /screen

let the application recreate them in the initialization process.


This one is curious.


Additionally, clearing a bunch of packages that I didn't need off the
Newton and freezing others completely stablized my Newton
(*knock*knock*).

Well, I won't say that to you, but I already tried this.

I did not restore anything except for my Notes (no system information,
or "Other" as it says in NCU).

All packages have been downloaded from UNNA and installed, not restored.

The next option I will try is to export my "index.html" note to the Mac
so I can import it instead of restoring it.

That way, as far as my newton is concerned, everything is brand new to it.

Even so, after I installed NIE and drivers for my ethernet card, then
hHTTPd,.. I used TrashPak to make sure there were not any additional
soups there. Then I opened nHTTPd to initialize it, then installed the
other NPDS packages.

This was a "no-go".

Update...

After many erase/brain wipe/soup deletes, then re-installing different
versions of nHTTPd I have noticed one common thing.

I seems that when I try to hit stop in the nHTTPd app, the ethernet
connection never is closed. After waiting and closing down all apps, I
can still ping the newton and get a response. The green, active light on
my ethernet card's dongle stays lit as well.

This leads me to believe that I might have a bad package of some part of
NIE. I downloaded them all from UNNA, but something might have happened
along the way.

I will try to find different instances of these packages (I have some
backed-up on CD-ROM) and start over again.

I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS even if it keeps me up to late (oh
well, since I've been laid off I'll have more time). 

Uuuugh!

OK. I thought first that the problem was that you weren't able to 
connect at all to your server, but all you describe in fact means 
that nHTTPd doesn't re-instantiate a new endpoint and re-listens. I 
really wonder why, but Grant mentioned problems with the latency, and 
I think you should investigate this.

I don't think this is the cause of your problems.

Umm, I'm really sorry that it doesn't work :-(
Maybe an exception occurs when reinstantiating an endpoint. Could you 
please install BugTrap, set it to catch exceptions into try-catch and 
see if any log is generated after you make the first hit to the 
server?

Yes. I already did this hoping to see a reason.

Bugtrap does not generate any log at all (with "Crashing inside a 'Try'

From: David Drew <nospam_david_at_hydrowash.com_dot_au>

Hi,
I thought I'd try to be the first to get in with this...

For those who haven't seen it already, go and have a look at (what is 
probably) the new iWalk, a sub-laptop / PDA by apple at www.spymac.com. 
Features are fantastic.

Since it's based on OS X, I guess we will have to use Apache for our web 
serving, instead of NPDS. If it's not part of the standard install, I 
can imagine it won't take people long at all to port Apache.

I'm just happy that there's a 21st C replacement for my trusty Newton. 
Hail Apple!

David Drew

Or should you say: the pic on SpyMac was too 'Photoshop-crap' to be true...

I'm sorry to disapoint you, but everybody saw it already and everybody knows
it's just another fake... People trusting this picture either have no taste
or aren't aware of Apple's new aesthetic rules, at all. (or both?)

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] NPDS updates

Hi all,

I've just uploaded a couple of new versions of packages for the 
branch of NPDS I'm working on.
They can be found on this branch's website http://npds.free.fr
I'm also posting this on NTLK (on the contrary to what I usually do) 
to advertise these NPDS updates before NPDS 3.0.

What is NPDS?
=============
You know how much Apache is superior to any other desktop OS-web 
server solution? You know how much NewtonOS is superior to any other 
OS? Well, you therefore know what NPDS is :)
This web server was written by Matt Vaughn from a TCP Server code by 
Ray Rischpater. It runs on any 2.x Newton, although you probably 
would have some problems on a MP120.

Matt published NPDS 2.01 on his website 
(http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearDesign/NPDS/).

This branch derives from his code. It has been improved by Victor 
Rehorst who wrote the NPDS Java Tracker, Adam Tow and myself. It is 
tested on a daily basis by several active Newton users. Thanks to 
them all.

Because Ray's code is licensed under GPL (although it's illegal under 
NewtonOS), NPDS is licensed under GPL as well. However, all the code 
Matt, Adam Tow and I wrote is licensed under a BSD-like license 
(except the GIF Server for which I have to determine if I'm violating 
Unisys patent).

Anyway, it's open source, in case you want to give a hand.

Who uses NPDS?
==============

Could be you! A lot of Newton users do. Anyone who has a Newton, a 
permanent connection and a way to share it with their Newton should 
at least at night (you don't sleep with your Newton, do you?).
Users who share their Newton usually register them on a tracker, such 
as misato (http://misato.chuma.org:2110) or shakti tracker 
(http://shakti.continuity.cx:2110/).
NPDS users are usually on this branch of NPDS's mailing list (even if 
you use the other branch, you can register) where other users help 
them to setup their Newton, give advices and report bugs among other 
things. We even had our iPod thread :). You can subscribe by sending 
a mail with subscribe in the subject to npds-request@ml.free.fr. All 
that is ad free.

What is new?
============

The new modules fix several causes of problems which lead to server 
crashes (NPDS sometimes stops serving pages). Also, I've included a 
lot of debug lines to fix these bugs and a little change in the 
NoteServ module to help design of cool websites.

nHTTPd 2.040
------------
  Fixed the SetRemove problem (thanks Sean) with a workaround. I think 
this is why the server sometimes refused to close every endpoint
  Added plenty of verbose lines and updated the previous ones.

NotePad Server 2.043
--------------------
  Various cleanups
  Added more verbose outputs when kDebugOn is TRUE
  Any note with a title ending with .css or .js or .htm or .html won't 
be translated to HTML. However, I think that the MIME type sent is 
text/html. Bah, this is just a temporary change before NPDS 3.0 alpha 
1.

GIF Server 1.11
---------------
  Fixed a bug causing the endpoint to not be closed.

Binary Server 1.01
------------------
  Fixed the same bug also present there. I checked, it's not present 
anywhere else.

Hey Paul.

Thanks for all of the updates. Quite honestly I don't think we were 
expecting any. It's certainly a nice surprise prior to any NPDS 3.0 
releases. However, (and oh how I hate to hear that word myself...) I have 
found a couple of minor (read: cosmetic) issues with the latest releases.

>nHTTPd 2.040

     The version number is still set to 2.039.

     This version is not on the npds.free.fr server. Oops.

>GIF Server 1.11
>---------------

     The version number is still set to 1.

I know these are minor things (well, except that the new Notepad Server 
is incognito at the moment), but I really do like to see exactly what 
version I have installed.

Thanks again.

Hi again Paul.

This is what you get when I start snooping around...

I noticed that the BinInstaller archive will not decompress after

Fixed in 2.041.
Other change for 2.041: Mozilla 5 is now considered as a modern 
browser, i.e. it will be sent inline CSS.
Note: I think that inline CSS will disapear with NPDS 3.0 (and 
generally speaking, CSS from the nHTTPd module).
Instead, we'll have templates (for notes converted to HTML by NPDS 
but also for every module showing stuff) and external CSS (which you 
have since NotePad 2.043).

I also think that I'm going to merge (for that reason) nHTTPd and 
NoteServ packages.

OK, this was the Friday lunch thoughts. Feel free to comment as 
usual. I'll start with the kernel so you've got the time to convince 
me to do otherwise :)

Fixed. I also forgot to update the version anyway.
OK, the problem with updating the version is that you need to perform 
a reset (otherwise, you'll get errors) and then to reconfigure the 
note pad server. Cf Josh's note about what options means there. 
Anyone mirrored it? Josh, could I put it on the npds.free.fr server?

You're right to complain, Grant.

Same problem here, so I uploaded the archive again.

BTW, my little finger told me that there might be a (probably 
supported) windoze tool to upload binaries for the Binary Server. I 
might fix the big binaries serving problem then.

Also, I ran the new modules the whole night and the watcher didn't 
restart my Newton at all. There are still non thread safe problems 
with the stats, but I think that here we got one of the most stable 
release of NPDS for this branch.

If you do the same experience (and if you don't report too many 
bugs), I'll declare these new modules as the supported ones.

Hrm, I've never been described as someone's little finger before...
(leaves self open to jokes)

Anyways, yes, I hope to cook something up in VB for this tomorrow.  If
anyone has RealBASIC they could probably fairly easily port it to Mac
(although I'll be using Sloup on the Newton side, meaning you'll need
serial ports).

I think this makes perfect sense from a usability standpoint, since that 
primary function of nHTTPd is to serve local documents. I think this will 
make for a much simpler and easier to understand package, at least in 
terms of attempting to describe base functionality and configuration when 
we start rewriting the documentation.

It was not so much a complaint, as an observation. Thanks for taking care 
of these niggling little issues.

Paul, I was wondering whether anything happens on my Newt if I install 
the BinInstaller package without actually compiling a new version 
containing my own customer binary data. Silly, me... I was in full-blown, 
heads-down, install-every-update mode and mistakenly installed the 
default BinInstaller package without thinking. Is there any harm in doing 
so?

I think the default package installs the serve NPDS gif image you 
(and I) have on your Newton.
You can access it at an address like /bin/images/serve-npds.gif.

If it doesn't work or you don't want it, just delete the Binary soup 
(in Extras->Storage).

Yes, they do seem very solid. Nicely done.

The only thing I've run across is a pestering little issue with the NPDS 
Cache viewer. I cleaned out all of the cache entries, and then BugTrap 
generated the following error when the Cache window was closed:

http://newton.splorp.com:8080/html/32227393$338.nsd

Yes, I can duplicate the problem. I don't recall having this problem in 
earlier versions of nHTTPd. I could be mistaken though.

Except that I succeeded to crash NPDS twice (once crashing the NS 
task, once it simply stopped serving). But it was with my new (but 
not ready yet) intensive website.

Bah, it will wait 3.0.

BTW, I fixed a little bug in NoteServ:

NoteServ 2.044

* Notes ending with .css, .js, .htm and .html no longer have their 
endlines translated to <BR>.

I noticed this already, but the exception is caught and you normally 
shouldn't see it. Set BugTrap to not log exceptions in try/catch 
blocks (and this definitely explains why you continued to get some 
exceptions which I could only fix by catching them (in the watcher)) 
;)

Zoinks, Paul! That's something like eight software releases or revisions 
(including DictBR) in the last two days. You're going to burn out both 
your keyboard and your net connection at this rate. Not that I'm 
complaining or anything... :)

I was wondering what the recommended settings for BugTrap were. I've just 
been using it straight out of the box. Is there anything in the BugTrap 
report itself that specifically indicates whether the exception is one 
classified as try/catch?

At any rate, I'll make the change.

Did you count latest VNC client which includes some native code I wrote today for Steve? :)
[Actually, it's just a 20-lines function to fill a binary bitmap with some value, I have to write some other function for him and he has to test the SetPixel function I last wrote - did I mention that this code may be included in Waba?]

Look at my screen (http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/screen/) until my server crashes.
However, the default is ignored for exceptions in try/catch blocks.

Ok, there's a picker for "Crashing inside a Try" - I currently have had 
that set to simply "Is Ignore". There is no mention of a "catch". Are 
these the same things we are talking about?

I put it in HTML with little formatting (basically removing links to 
other pages on your Newton since they don't include hostname and you 
don't have a domain name/fixed IP).

In fact, I didn't open it immediatly.
(if the Newton restarts, what you can see is the login screen with 
the NS Debug Tools alert)

Yes (try/catch is in fact the Java/C++ way to call it, on NewtonOS, 
it's try/onexception), and apparently, you have it properly set (a 
lot of exception are thrown and catched, so most of the time you 
don't need to log them).

OK, I fixed the bug in ProtoSoupBrowser.

So this morning we have:

ProtoSoupBrowser 1.1

Fixed bug when closing the browser with no entry left.
  (in fact commented useless code which has the effect of generating an
  exception in that particular case)
  [Grant: 20011026-32227393$]

I followed Paul's installation suggestions when installing the newest 
release, but found something else:

Go into your NPDS Setup package, tap on the Content tab, and uncheck and 
recheck the "Insert CSS" (if you are using the built-in css for your 
pages).  Apply this, and the Newton should start serving the pages up 
more or less as they looked before.  However, there seems to be some 
formatting differences.

Also, the whole link back to the main page and the Note information at 
the bottom of the Note does not seem to be included.

Additionally, my pages do not serve well at all in iCab 2.5.3 on OS X 
10.1.  Mozilla looks fine, but in iCab pages are truncated!

Thanks,

Josh

I'm experiencing this as well. None of the pages served via NoteServ have 
the style sheet applied to them. That's why they look wonky. I've gone 
back to running 2.043 for the time being.

Subject: [NPDS] Problem with new upgrade

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Well the subject is only half true. My problems started when I installed 
the very beta driver for Lucent WaveLAN.

Earlier I used a 3com 3c589D Etherlink III ethernet card.
With this configuration everything (NPDS) worked like a charm.

I installed the WaveLAN driver to play with it and see how it was. Long 
story.

After this install, every time my Newt rebooted (cause of NPDS Watcher) I 
got an error from NPDS, and that led to a new restart, and the reboot loop 
was a fact.
The error I got was:
Server
InetGrabLink -61001

It doesn't seem like it is opening a connection at all.
If I managed to turn off the NPDS Watcher, I could "Stop" NPDS. Every time 
I "stop" it NPDS gives me the NIE connection option to choose what 
ethernet card I would like to connect to.
When I choose the right driver from this connection window, NPDS 
stops, and I can start it again without problems.

So I deleted the Lucent driver and forced NPDS watcher to reboot my newt, 
and then I got some new errors.
If I started NPDS from Extras or the NPDS button on my background app. I 
got these errors:
- -48809
- -8007
- -48204

If NPDS Watcher tried to start up NPDS after a reboot I only got this 
eror:
- -48808
This happends at the same time as there is opened a window with 
Initializing.

So I deleted everything on my Newton. Restored everything except NPDS. 
INstalled NPDS over again, and now I am back to my first problem. I still 
get the -61001 error if NPDS Watcher is trying to start NPDS for me.

Does anybody have a sollution for this problem? Or any guesses?

Argh, now my NPDS counter is reset again... 

Best,

-61001 means that NIE couldn't initialize the network card.  Check the
default internet setup in your (default) worksite.  If it's not set to the
internet setup you're currently using, then when your Newton reboots, NPDS
watcher will try to use the default internet setup to reconnect, and if
this is invalid (ie. it's set to use a card that isn't inserted or doesn't
exist) then it will emit this error.

Hi all,

I was trying in install the Script Editor package and NCU hangs. The
progress bar is completely filled but never goes away. I need to cancel
the download; then there is no Script Editor on the Newton. I also
tried installing on another Newton and the same problem occurs. Anyone
else have this problem? I assume Acript Editor appears as application
in the Unfiled folder, but I've checked all icons but no editor is
found.

What version of the editor are you installing? Did you grab the version 
from the NPDS development server?

     http://npds.free.fr/Utilities/

I wasn't able to install this version after downloading myself. Perhaps 
the copy on the server is corrupted. Hey Paul, when you have a minute, 
could you upload a new copy of just the Script Editor package? The 
Stuffit archive of the source code seems to be fine.

In the meantime, you can download a copy of the original version (1.0) of 
the Script Editor from my site. It works fine with the latest NPDS 
packages. It's the one I am still using.

     http://www.splorp.com/download/editor.pkg

Actually, is there any difference between Script Editor 1.0 which comes 
with NPDS 2.02 (from Matt's site) and the one that exists on npds.free.fr 
server? Just curious.

I also had problems with this copy recently, I just forgot to mention it

Well, apparently, yes, there was a difference. One was corrupted and

Hi Paul,

I just downloaded from your site the ScriptEditor-2.0.pkg (Last modified
Nov. 12th). It installed fine but the version still says 1.0. Is this
correct?

See, that's what was confusing me. Both packages seemed to be identical, 
yet the one on the npds.free.fr site was externally labeled as 2.0.

You can enter pretty much any IP address into the Public IP field of the 
tracker client. I would simply put in a generic (fake) IP address such as 
0.0.0.100 or similar. Since you're behind a firewall, no one will be able 
to hit your Newton anyway, but at least the tracker client will be able 
to register with the tracker server. One issue that this causes is that 
the tracker server will not be able to verify that your Newton is still 
active and will remove it from the listing during the next validation 
cycle. Your best way to combat this and to make sure that your device is 
listed as much as possible is to set up a regular, automatic registration 
schedule within the tracker client. To do this, tap the button with the 
pi symbol.

You are using the most recent version (2.035) of the tracker client, 
right?

I hope that this helps.

What's the interest to register to the tracker if you can't be 
reached from the internet? :)
Just don't install the tracker client (resp. all the NDPS modules) 
and all your problems will be solved :))

Seriously, I think that we need a documentation explaining what 
happens and how to configure all stuff in the following situations:
a/ there is a router of some kind (say an Airport base)
b/ one accesses the internet with a MacOS/X/Windoze/Linux machine and 
wants to have their Newton reachable from the internet.

I'm ready to change the interface of the tracker client or other 
elements if you think it would help. I also could write the parts for 
IPNetRouter, iptables (linux kernel 2.4.x) or the Airport base.

As usual, comments welcome. Now, I have newtToDo and a real To Do 
list, unfortunately growing much faster than I can mark task as 
complete :)

Subject: [NPDS] [Survey] Top 10 reasons to use the Newton as a web server

I found a note on Chris Richmond's website with that title 
(http://sharky.ne.mediaone.net:8080/html/28401578$5.nsd), and I 
wondered:
a/ what are the reasons why you run NPDS on your Newton
b/ what are the reasons why you would like to run NPDS on your Newton.

In a nutshell, what are the ten points you would put?
This could serve as the basis for the evangelist part of the NPDS 3.0 
documentation.

I don't have enough imaginations for 10 points I guess. I would put:
1/ it's the easiest way to transfer notes from the Newton to the 
desktop computer, whatever the desktop computer is
2/ if you forget your Newton when you go the library, you can leave 
notes about books you're reading on it just via the internet consoles
3/ it doesn't make any sound or it can makes plenty of sounds 
including a surprising count down and click sounds for every hit
BTW, this afternoon I was late as usual and the Newton crashed but 
wasn't restarted by the watcher yet, so I took the ethernet card out, 
put the secondary linear card in, restarted it and put it in my bag, 
and in the subway, I heard the count down sound -- nobody has noticed 
apparently, but when I had to change the line, I took my Newton out, 
shut the sound off and stopped NPDS.
4/ you can design web pages anywhere including in boring lectures on 
the Java language (although these days, I'm so tired that I can't 
help sleeping)

simple.  it was an out of box message board for my company intranet 
where we could all gripe about the bosses with no one the wiser. I 
could pack it up at the end of the day and not worry about the 
information falling into the wrong hands. of course I eventually got

My thoughts...

>a/ what are the reasons why you run NPDS on your Newton

* It's one of the classic examples of the incredibly cool things you can 
still do with the Newton. A full-blown web server on a handheld? You 
betcha.

* I enjoy the challenge of running as many servers on as many computers 
as I can. This point also explains the BeBox running PoorMan and the 
Quadra 950 running MacHTTP in my basement.

* It's an extremely handy way to record and publish BugTrap reports for 
all of the software I'm beta testing.

* It's a unified and portable writing, publishing, editing, archiving, 
and online distribution tool.

* WebPager honks. Nuf said.

Subject: [NPDS] Admin Post now really broken
From: Josh Burker <nospam_senorwences_at_mac_dot_com>

Just so everybody is aware, the /html/admin-post.html page on the NPDS 
server does not seem to work at all anymore (whereas before it simply 
wouldn't file anywhere but the WWW folder as defined in the NPDS 
setup).  Specifically, it the the call to the /html/admpst.ns that is 
broken, as you end up at the 404 page if you click Submit.

I like the function of the Admin Post (though most people probably don't 
use it) because in theory I could post to any of my Notes folders 
remotely, which would be handy for Notes that not everyone needs to 
see.  Perhaps this could be implemented as part of the version 3 
overhaul.

Thanks,

Josh Burker

Argh, it's probably the size of the document I'm trying to submit, not 
the Admin Post itself that is broken beyond not filing correctly.  Sorry 
about that!

Crap. You see what happens when you don't read _all_ of the 
documentation. I had absolutely no idea you could do this. Sweet baby 
corn, this is cool...

Building on Josh's note above, what I would like to see in version 3.0 is 
the ability to edit and delete existing posts via a remote web admin 
interface. That would be amazingly useful.

I'm still agog.

Indeed, I never used the Admin post feature, but I happened to send 
text to my Newton using the regular post note feature and then I file 
the note (thus later). I realize that you might not want the note to 
be seen by others.
Please just tell me where you expect the admin note to be filed, and 
I'll fix the problem one of these nights between 0400 and 0412.

First off, take care of yourself and we're in no rush.

Second, I would like the existing *function* to remain:  a pulldown menu 
on the html page that allows the administrator to file the Note in 
whichever Notes folder already exists on the Newton.  NPDS' preference 
to use the www or www post folder should stay the same; if the admin 
posts to the www or ww posts folder, the Note is available; if not, it's 
filed on the Newton, but not available from NPDS.

And since we're talking about it, how about in version 2 the ability for 
the admin to post to Dates, and/or others to post to Dates.  Matt had a 
version of NPDS at some point that he hinted at at some point; this 
would be handy for me as lately I seem to be leaving my Newton serving 
while I am remote.

Perhaps you could fit the Dates coding into 0412 and 0413 ;)  Seriously, 
Paul, my girlfriend just took the GRE (I hope you do/did well) and the 
cold season is upon the world; take care.

Josh

PS  I have a preliminary draft of the documentation for running NPDS 
behind a router/firewall; the first page is at:

Josh,

Earlier this week my LAN question was posted to this list regarding
running NPDS behind router/firewall. I would like to thank everyone who
provided support.

Unfortunately, the solutions suggested didn't solve the problem, because,
I finally came to the realization that the router's NAT was "dynamically"
being assigned by provider during every dial up session.

Indeed, as mentioned in your documentation, my situation is multiple
computers within home "manual" assigned IP LAN setup. Not much unlike the
DHCP situation you mentioned, with "dynamically" assigned NAT, the daily
NAT IP address changes made the situation not ideal to run NPDS. It might
be appropriate to mention this situation in NPDS documentation.

I found your draft documentation clear and concise providing easy
understanding of set-up.

Best regards,

Michael

I'm unsure of what you mean by "the router's NAT was 'dynamically' being
assigned" by your ISP.  Do you mean that the IP address that your router
uses to connect to the internet is being provided by DHCP?  Because my IP
address for my router (an OpenBSD box you'll learn more about as the
documentation progresses) also is assigned by DHCP, but my IPFilter/NAT
rules are written in such a way to account for this.

What's your router; I've been researching the most popular and have a good
sense as to what will work and not work.  Let me know, and I might be able
to help you on that.

BTW, there's more documentation but I've updated it on my iBook and just
need to get it onto the Newton.

Cheers,

Josh

Yes, this is what I had originally thought!
I have done several brain wipes, and started from scratch each time.

The reason for why my NPDS server was not working, is too shameful to admit.
I  had a directory on my desktop that had all the packages needed (after 
a brain wipe) for NPDS.
This directory failed to have the "NIE Ethernet Enabler.pkg" in it!
The funny thing about this is;
When I would first launch NPDS, it would serve requests for about 1 
whole second, then deny everything else.
I could still ping my newton's IP address from the network.

Oh Well! Once again, I feel like an idiot! Ha Ha!
I guess this goes along with that whole RTFM thing we were talkin' about 
yesterday.

It might be a nice idea to have the ability to associate a set of Tracker

have to go and reconfigure the Tracker client every time.  Maybe I'm just
being picky.

Just thought that I'd let you know that misato.chuma.org will be going
down shortly before 4:00pm EST for electrical maintenance (long story, but
after today, our stove will be reconnected).  It looks like the shakti
tracker is back up, so I suggest you use that in the interim.  Hopefully,
misato won't be down longer than three hours.

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Java Tracker Server 0.1.28

Hi all,

A new version of Victor's Java Tracker Server is available. Why? 
because I was tired of going to the admin console to set misato 
server to share everytime Victor shut down electricity. (why the hell 
did you buy a washing machine? :)

What's new?

* Fixed the bug of getting the shareEnabled prefs. Note: the old .ini 
file doesn't work anyway. I followed Victor's idea to use the class 
Boolean to read this value and therefore, if it's 'true' (and since 
Java 1.0.2, this is case insensitive) the server is set to share. If 
it's anything else (e.g. 1), it's set to not share.

* The server no longer saves REGUP commands for SHAREd entries.

You'll find the new server here:

http://npds.free.fr/%20Tracker%20Server/NPDSTracker-0.1.28/

It's what shakti is running right now.

In a previous message, Jeremy Bond Shepherd typed vigorously:

I usually get these generically titled posts if I have the "Posts" folder 
open in Notes when BugTrap generates an error report. The normal BugTrap 
report gets placed into the "Unfiled" folder, but another blank note gets 
placed into the "Posts" folder (I'm not sure why). This blank or empty 
note, which has the same type of title as you describe shows up in the 
NPDS <NOTE_LIST>, but cannot be accessed (the 500 error as above).

I found that if you simply open the note on the Newton and refile the 
note into the same folder and try again you can then load the note you 
your browser. It must have something to do with the way blank notes are 
named by default.

Do you happen to know how these notes are being created originally? It 
seems that creating a new note within the Notes application doesn't cause 
this same behavior.

BTW, I've crossed posted this message to the NPDS list as well.

Yep, I can confirm that this happens when I create new notes manually as 
well. It's just that the error I get when BugTrap creates the note is 
different than the one that appears in NPDS when I create the note 
manaually. I got bit confused by that.

it's been around in the last few revisions.

You need to join the list before you can officially post to it.

Grant,

I did some more experimenting... this is an odd problem indeed.

All of the notes I created myself in the notepad (i.e., Tap New 
then Note) seem to serve fine with or without a title.

The problem notes are ones that were created using Ink Spot 
"Save to Notepad" feature. If they have a title, they serve 
fine. If they DON'T have a title, they successfully serve about 
30% of the time. The rest of the time they throw 500 errors. 
Giving them a title, refreshing NOTE_LIST and then re-serving 
results in success.

Most of the notes I had in my Posts folder were ones I filed 
there from Ink Spot, which is why the problem looked as 
widespread during my first experiments.

-Jeremy

Fine, I'll fix this bug with the admin post bug some day (probably 
when I'll be able to sleep less than 5 hours and be fresh enough to 
code). It seems to be a pretty simple bug.

Indeed, Jeremy. I got two messages from Listar about your not being 
on the NPDS list and trying to post. I didn't have the time to handle 
them yet, as in such a case, I need to double check that you're not 
on the list with another e-mail address and contact you to solve the 
problem (and post the messages nevertheless if it's a double e-mail 
address conflict).

NewtonTalk has the same restriction (you need to be on the list to 
post messages), and I hate so much spam that goes to open mailing 
lists that I'm not sure I'm about to configure it differently.

I get these occasionally after someone takes a bunch of screenshots one 
after another. I think it has something to do with a certain part of a 
connection not getting closed correctly. I could be way off though. Just 
a though... if you are using port 80 to serve through, and you server is 
accessible publicly, you might want to try a different port (like 8080 or 
similar). Every once in a while, when the Code Red and other assorted 
Microsnot-targeted viruses start propagating, they can hammer web servers 
that use the default port 80 pretty hard. Since I've started using an 
alternate port, NPDS has been much more stable.
