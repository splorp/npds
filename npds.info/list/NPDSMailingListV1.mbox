I haven't tried on my server (and currently we are the only two 
online), but this is very likely a bug. I'll track it down and I'll 
fix it with the next release.

Actually, no, this is not a service from the mailing lists hosted by 
free. (but we have no ad in exchange, and I hate ads, spams, people 
trying to sell things or distributing tracts to offer you to 
participate to some casting, seminars, ads for carpets, etc. - there 
are so many in the Quartier Latin (a district in inner Paris), it's a 
real pain.

I checked the help file, and it allows to subscribe in digest mode 
and both digest and normal. (to get it, send a mail to 
npds-request@ml.free.fr with help in the digest). I'll advertise this 
feature in the welcome file, because some people may want to receive 
digests only (we are not as busy as NTLK, but well, ...).

Anyway, if ever you want to make some interface like NTLK, please do. 
I'll advertise the page in the info text.
I can send you in most formats the previous messages, I have them all.

Greetings,

I have stopped the tracking of my MP NPDS since it now has a fixed IP address
and name, so you won't see it listed there. I have integrated it into the
Paleobotany section web site (http://www.dartmouth.edu/daghlian/paleo/ or go
straight to PaleoNews at http://paleonews.dartmouth.edu), so it should get a
little bit of a workout. Now to see how long it takes to crash. I have had to
reset the machine once already due to the UndoEntryChanges call noted
previously.

I'm just trying to make the little MP earn its keep.

Howdy...

I've been meaning to upgrade all my NPDS components, but realized I have
a few questions:

1) Do I need to delete all the old pkgs before installing the new?
2) If the answer to 1) is no, then can I just fire up the new pkgs when
I'm done upgrading, and all my settings will be intact?
3) I have a custom index.html note, will that still be automatically
loaded when I fire up the upgraded pkgs?

Sorry if these are stupid questions, and thanks for your help!

I'll email when I'm back up and running...

>1) Do I need to delete all the old pkgs before installing the new?

All new packages have the same signature than the old one.
The exception is the GIF Server, but the new one is not based at all 
on the old one. They just use the same path (/screen/).

You can remove them all, it's not a bad idea. Think about restarting 
once all packages are installed.

>2) If the answer to 1) is no, then can I just fire up the new pkgs when
>I'm done upgrading, and all my settings will be intact?

No, all your settings won't be intact. But this is the last time 
settings are reset. This is because the old packages had another way 
to handle settings. They are reverted to default when some important 
upgrade occurs. Now, the packages try to guess what needs to be 
updated/reverted/removed.

Here is the upgrading note:

There is another bug, but it probably was in the old packages: note 
search's results give bad links.

I'm not sure about what you mean by firing up the upgraded packages 
(I haven't found the expression in any of my dictionaries, including 
The Chambers), but the index.html lookup method is still the same.

Subject: [NPDS] .nsd.nsd fix?

Hello,

Am I the only one having trouble with the note-search call in NPDS? When I use
it on my site (paleonews.dartmouth.edu), I get a page returned with links to
notes , but the links have  an .nsd.nsd ending (like this:
/html/-183691048$45.nsd.nsd). 

Obviously the script is appending an extra .nsd. Is there an easy way to fix
this? 

In trying to keep  NPDS  going for as long as possible, I am slowly remioving
(or freezing) lots of other packages. Still there are the occasional mystery
freezes with no solution other than a complete power off, battery out, cards out
rest period as fix. The EntryUndoChanges call still occasionally causes trouble,
but less so now that I have frozen X-Port Custom.

On a related note, does anyone know how to convert a list of names and addresses
to Names format? I have used X-Port with limited success. The file was put away
to names, but with the name being as much as three lines of the file. Searched
in NPDS, the information is returned ok, but the formatting is a bit off.

Regards,

Chuck

I get an internal server error message very often when I call the
<NOTE_LIST> SSI - but the server survives and can still serve any other page
that does not have this included.  What is interesting is that it does not
occur _every_ time - yesterday I was able to use this SSI with no problem.
I have never seen the .nsd.nsd problem, but perhaps this is what is causing
an internal error?  (Strange that it would behave so differently on
different machines...)

This new build of Paul's is not quite as stable as the old one (that's the
price of the bleeding edge...) - my record for staying up without a freeze
is about five to six hours (and that's without running RemoteCam, which
brings the performance down into the ten to twenty minute range...).  I
reckon that almost half of the hits are not resolved, either, and don't make
it into the log.

But dang that new pGIFServer is nice!

This is a known bug. Sorry folks, I haven't a lot of spare time, and 
when I do, I work on the ATA driver. Anyway, this is a known bug, 
probably already in the previous versions of NPDS.

Additionnally, there is the EntryUndoChanges stuff. I thought I 
removed them all but I forgot this one. It is strictly useless and 
even causes bug.

Umm. Such behavior means hard to track bugs.
I believe there is something wrong with your notes.

This is at the origin of no internal error. This should occur on all 
MPs. It is in the notes search results.

Hits are always counted.
The problem comes from the fact that NPDS wasn't written to support 
several connections at the same time. With a hack of the TCP Server 
itself, I enabled this feature, but this causes a lot of bugs.

You can increase the lifetime of the Newton by deactivating the 
reverse DNS feature. (not perfect, but usually enough).

To fix that, I have to rewrite the whole core of NPDS. I have started 
that, it won't take too long.

Paul

Paul,

I didn't mean to imply you are not a hard worker. If it gets taken care of
sometime, that's good enough for me. The ATA driver will be nice, too.

I just got another MP2100, so I will be stripping down the stuff on the NPDS MP
to maximize its stability (assuming other packages may cause problems,too).

Hi,
  This morning I decided to put my newton server up on the web. It naturally
went to register with the tracker (130.126.50.66). Everything seemed fine,
yet when I went to the tracker page, the server wasn't listed there, even
after a few retries with both the page, and the tracker client.

  I'm using the same settings that I've used previously, and it worked fine
then. Is anyone else having this problem?

Thanks,

The problem was apparently caused by a bug in the tracker which 
blocks it. (somehow related to REALBasic according to Matt).

Anyway, I have just restarted the tracker. I should say it is the 
very first time I do that, and it was successful. It even remembers 
who was in the list. Nice job Matt.

BTW, you can tell if the tracker is down or not: when you try to 
register manually, if the tracker client is closed automatically, it 
wasn't able to connect to the server. This can have two causes: the 
tracker is down or NPDS/Something else but very probably NPDS 
scrambled your internet connection. (to ensure that the tracker was 
down, I telnet to the tracker and ask for the ABOUT command).

The client currently doesn't tell about the server's status and the 
command result.

Another cause for being unregistered is when you are unreachable for 
too long. This happens when NPDS scrambles the connection, you 
provided a bad IP/name, the connection gets broken.

If you upgraded to the latest suite (130.126.50.66/npds/current), 
there is a bug which disconnects your Newton. (in fact, there are two 
bugs and enabling DNS lookup worsen the problem). I'll fix that ASAP 
(it means redesigning the interaction between the modules), but 
currently, I'm working on another bug tracking project.

Paul

Subject: [NPDS] Tracker Stuff.

I made a minor change to my tracker server that might fix the intermittent problem in the server verification code that was causing it to get stuck.

It looks like sometimes a timeout out exception doesn't always fire properly for hosts that are down. Also on occasion I was getting buffer full errors from Java somewhere.

I'd appreciate it if people running NPDS servers could use my tracker for the next few days to see if I've fixed the problem. Just point your Tracker Client to 131.104.48.34 port 2110.

Matt, maybe you could put a link to my tracker from yours?

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS Crashes
From: "Josh Burker" <nospam_Josh_Burker_at_misd.wednet_dot_edu>

Hello all:

	I've been running my NPDS on my MP2100 for several weeks now with no
problems.

	However, this morning somebody (I'm not logging) dropped by my Newton and
pulled up the screen (I'm running Paul's newest version of the GIFServer
and have removed the two older GIFServer components).  This caused my
Newton to crash:  it rebooted itself and told me that a system error had
caused the crash (no error number was reported)

	Subsequently, I was unable to take a screenshot without the Newton
crashing.  I went through and removed a bunch of packages to make sure I
had plenty of room (I have about a meg left on my 10mb card in the PCMCIA
slot, about 800k left internally).  I also removed the GIFServer package
and reinstalled it, trashed the NPDS storage and cleared the NPDS cache. 
Additionally, I ran SBM Utilities on the Newton to make sure everything
was in line there, which it seems to be.

	It seemed to work again, so I left it running for a while then came back
to it to make sure it was still running.  I got no response, so I
restarted the Newton (by pressing the restart button, since I got no
response from the Newton).  Upon bringing NPDS back up, I still got
crashes.  Again, I trashed the NPDS cache (deleted the NPDS entry from the
Storage area on the Newton) and deleted GIFServer.  I then rebooted the
Newton and reinstalled GIFServer, and it served a screenshot for me.

	I seem to have plenty of heap available when I'm doing the screenshots,
and this has never been a problem in the past.  What has become corrupted?

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks,

Josh Burker

I was getting my server hanging every few hours when I had the screenshot
(with the new GIFServer) on my homepage.  I think there's probably just
some problems with the C++.  I dunno.

Josh's story let me think NPDS stores the picture in the cache, but I 
may be wrong. (as you probably already know, I have no MP2x00 left to 
work on). Could you check with a soup browser?

Otherwise, if you want, the GIF server I sent is still the debug 
version. Connect to NTK and take a screen shot. See if it is verbose 
(otherwise, it is verbose only to Hammer or Newtsbug). If it is, keep 
it plugged. This may help me to find where the problem is until I get 
my Newton back.

Regards,

Paul

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [Protocol Draft] SHARE & QUERY - Or a network of trackers?

Hi all,

Since I worked a little with Victor on his java tracker server, I 
decided to resume the work on the protocol draft waiting for my 
Newton to come back in order to work on the ATA Support.

The draft is available at:
http://eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca/~victor/npds/NPDS_Protocol_1.1.html

And all contributions are welcomed.

I was thinking about the SHARE & QUERY commands which were defined 
for historical reasons. (With Victor, we are working on the SHARE 
bug).

Here's the plot: the trackers can share with others the Newtons they 
know to be up. This feature was actually designed by Matt.

Now, from that, I think that a good idea would be a network of 
available trackers, each sharing with each others the Newtons that 
are up. I also thought about a method of telling the Newtons which 
became orphans that their tracker died and offering them to register 
on ourself.

With that, we'll have a strong network of trackers. (I admit that 
this idea is probably not worth it for our faithful Newtons, but I 
like the idea of a strong network for the Newton's sake).

Now, this means some changes in the SHARE and QUERY methods. If I 
understand what we drafted in July-August, the SHARE command is for 
servers registered on a tracker and QUERY for them all. This doesn't 
seem really worth it having two commands since it's better to know 
all Newtons another tracker knows, even if those Newtons were not 
registered on it. However, we need a command to know all data about 
Newtons, such as the Hash (unimplemented and even not documented - a 
unique hash of the unique ID to identify a Newton, so that we could 
have ICQ like icons) and the tracker this Newton is registered on.

However, we need a command for the Web Pager future design of getting 
access to someone's Newton: I thought that we could have a built-in 
dialog to send a message on the Web Pager and both bookmarks (well, 
simply recents first) and a button to download the list of currently 
up Newtons. For that, we need a simplified command, we don't need the 
last verification date, the status is maybe worth it, and we of 
course need the description and the URL.

I think that the best would be to keep SHARE for the first command 
and QUERY for the second.

Now, we'll have to choose when the sharing is done.
Here is a suggestion: (we could stick on what's currently half 
implemented in Victor's tracker)

A tracker server has three tasks:
- waiting forever for commands as described in the protocol
- verifying periodically that registered Newtons are alive
- calling other trackers periodically about the Newtons they know. By 
calling a tracker, a tracker tells the other it exists. A tracker 
should maintain between resets a list of trackers it knows, and for 
example have a mechanism like if a tracker is down for too long a 
time, it is removed from the list. The developer should create some 
interface to edit this list (e.g. Victor's console).

When calling a tracker, the tracker looks into the list of Newtons it knows.
If the tracker is down, it notes all the Newtons it knows belonging 
to this tracker as orphan.
Otherwise:
If the tracker claims a Newton, it updates the list (either changing 
the owner of the Newton and therefore clearing the orphan flag or 
creating a new entry)
If there are Newtons the tracker knew to belong to the tracker it 
called and that the tracker didn't declared as up again, it removes 
them from the list.

Then, it processes all orphan Newtons and calls them telling them 
announcing them the bad news and offering its services. It then 
clears the list.

On the client side, when receiving such a bad piece of news, the 
Newton adds this tracker in its known tracker list. If it is the 
first time it heard about the bad news, it answers "Yes, please 
register me" and notes that it now belongs to someone else. If it 
isn't the first time, it says "Thanks Pal, but I already belong to 
XXXX" giving the tracker an opportunity to grow its list.

Sounds a little complex, but well, I'm just waiting for your 
agreement to document it and implement it with Victor. Of course, I'd 
prefer first some comments.

[Victor: about the GMT bug: Misato seems to have the same problem as 
G3. Any idea?]

Regards,

Paul

If you are able to build it (and I'm sure you will be able to), this
implementation of the Tracker client sounds wonderful.

SHARE was conceived by Matt Vaughn. I wrote QUERY, but I can't remember why.

If sounds good. I think I will try to get SHARE fixed soon and you can document the new protocol stuff for v2 or maybe V3.

You are probably right.

I think that v1 should be limited to what Matt's tracker does 
properly (and what yours also do), and what's implemented in the 
client (well, partly because it should check the result).

REGUP
REGDN
ABOUT

and we forget about the QUERY command for the current QUERY format 
doesn't fit our needs (anyway, Matt says 404 Not Found).

Then, I'll document v1.1 with:
NPDS/TP extension (already defined in the draft)
Server sharing command (SHARE) & mechanism
Tracker query command (QUERY)
Tracker client orphan behavior

We may divide this in two steps if you think it's worth it.

Next step is additional REGUP (and therefore SHARE) data concerning 
Newtons such as latitude & longitude, character encoding for the 
description, etc.

Regards,

Paul

Thanks everyone who registered their Newtons on my tracker.  You can go
back to using the usual tracker now if you like.  Paul Guyot and I are
happily hacking away at my Java Tracker: some bugs have been squished,
it's now multithreaded, adn right now I'm working on making it more
user-friendly for people to run, and get a final (ha!) bug worked out.

(Matt - Paul mentioned that you weren't on this list, so I'm CCing you.. 
Once I'm done with this version of the Java tracker, I'll send you a copy
so you can run it on your box.  It'll be much better from the one you
tested before, I promise)

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [Protocol] SHARE & QUERY result

Hi all,

I've been working a little bit on the protocol this morning. I remind 
you where we're going to. There are two formats for commands, 1.0 and 
1.1
Everything that is 1.0 is what Matt's tracker does.

Some new commands are introduced with 1.1

Summary:

Command		Version		Format(s)	Purpose
ABOUT		1.0		1.0, 1.1	Tell about the server
REGUP		1.0		1.0, 1.1	Register a Newton
REGDN		1.0 (r)		1.0, 1.1	Unregister a Newton
SHARE		1.1		1.1		Communication between servers
QUERY		1.1		1.1		Get a list of known Newtons

(REGDN is just recommanded in version 1.0)

What's new in 1.1 is the ability to encode the Newton description in 
any character encoding. Besides, there can be line feeds in this 
description. (this can be restricted, it's one of the solutions to my 
problem).

The 1.0 format for REGUP is
REGUP host[:port] Description

And the description goes till the end of the line.

The 1.1 format for REGUP has the charset in the header and the 
description is in the body. Therefore the description goes till the 
end of the request.

Now, with the SHARE & QUERY methods, we need to return a list of the 
available servers/Newtons. My problem is: which format to choose.

I think that the best is to put in the headers the encoding of the whole body.
Then in the body a description of each server/newtons.

I found basically three options:
a/ we limit the Newton description to anything but carriage 
returns/line feeds. The structure of the SHARE & QUERY results will 
look like Victor's current response to these commands, i.e. data at 
the beginning of the line separated by tabulations, description at 
the end, next line is a new server/newton.
b/ we encode the carriage returns/line feeds with something like \n, \r.
c/ we use XML for the whole structure.

The easiest to implement (both the servers and the Newton should 
decode this result, the servers for the SHARE method, the Newton for 
the QUERY method) is point (a). But it has a serious limitation: the 
data about a Newton should be limited to have a single text with 
allowed tabulations.
However, with this new 1.1 format, this could be changed in the 
future if we need it.

What do you think about it?

Paul

The (a) option would be close to how the Newton descriptions are currently
offered on the Tracker page:  short and to the point, but customizable
like John Solon's Newton Exobrain.  If (a) is the easiest to implement but
changeable if you decide to revise the format I would suggest using (a). 
I'd say keep it simple:  that's part of the beauty of NPDS.  But I also
like the power behind the software, so implementing an option that can be
built upon makes sense.

Thanks,

Josh Burker

Subject: [NPDS] SSI

Hello all:

I've been running my NPDS server for a while now and I love the power of the SSI support that Matt Vaugh built into nHTTPd. I have also learned quite a bit about the supported SSI from Matt's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearMedia/NPDS/4AAMagazine/">4AA Magazine</a> as well as the online <a href=" http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearMedia/NPDS/">NPDS</a> documentation. However, I know that there are a few SSIs that are not documented (for instance, the one that takes the poster's email address and puts it at the end of their post) or perhaps it's CGI that's doing the work (I'm new to this).

Paul Filmer and the aforementioned resources have gotten me started on a serious lust for more SSI on my web server. Can some helpful individual help fill in some of the gaps in the documentation and help a serious geek spiff out his Newton web server? Of particular interest would be a means of collecting the poster's email address (this is already part of the NotePad server but I don't know how) so I could have the server, again using SSI or CGI (whatever it takes), generate a short thank you letter to be sent to the poster.

Thanks for any information,

I find that I cannot keep my server going for more than about 24 hours without a

It seems to vary from day to day.  Yesterday, for instance, I ran it all
day without it locking up at all.  However, I didn't have much traffic. 
Paul, any insight?

I was able to leave it for several days by disabling the reverse DNS 
feature and by setting the latency to 7 seconds.

It's a known bug. Sorry folks, I cannot work on it without my Newton.

I don't remember exactly (no time to look at the source right now) 
but I think this is not a SSI, just the normal behavior. (I modified 
that to add a link).

>or perhaps it's CGI that's doing the work (I'm new to this).

OK, there are two different things. It's not a CGI since CGI means 
Common Gateway Interface. Common Gateway Interface is based on old 
rusty technology ( from the 70's) called Unix. Nobody uses it anymore 
like Cobol except in some very particular cases. (Cobol is still used 
in many French chemistries, although this is changing).

SSI is a more general term.

NPDS has two kind of active pages.
In fact, all pages are active. They are processed by modules, and all 
modules get the data from soups or predifined pages. NotesServ takes 
the data from the Notes soup, and as you probably noticed, translates 
text to HTML (yes, I planned to add styles and even images as Victor 
suggested).
NotesServ also defines the WhiteBoard to create new notes. Instead of 
looking into the Notes soup, NotesServ processes the page.

SSIs works at the server level (surprising with such a name, isn't it?).
The interface doesn't look like usual SSIs. Instead, you define a 
SGML tag without parameter (yes, I planned to add parameters) that 
generates some text and can in fact do anything else.

You can define SSIs in the Script Editor coming with NPDS. There are 
SSIs defined by modules, too.
SSIs takes a parameter which is undocumented. Please don't rely on it 
as I planned to change it.

Paul Filmer made great SSIs like the domain collecting.

I think this is not simple to do, at least with the current 
architecture of NPDS. It will be much more natural with some changes 
I planned.

Indeed, the poster address is added because the poster puts the address.

I have an idea, though. You cannot know when the form is filled and processed.
However, you can register a handler when a new note is added. If you 
only register such a handler, you may have problems if the note is 
moved from one store to another. There are several solutions. One of 
them is that with a SSI, you can get called whenever a page (you 
designed) is viewed. So, if the user clicked the home link once a 
note is posted, and if there was 2 hits since the last note was added 
and if this note is a note the visitor wrote, you can send him a 
mail. Believe me, it's not very simple.

Now, I have planned to define templates pages in Matt's modules. If 
the template is defined in the NotesSoup, the server will use it 
instead of the default page. This way, you will be able to change the 
link a little bit and add your SSI there. I will consider your 
problem when defining that.

Paul

 Same, usually less than 24 hrs. 
Even with Matt Vaugh's last NPDS version, it would not run for more than a
few days without crashing. I am suspicious of the heap cleaning in Avi's
backdrop - it counts down to some very low values, and I have tried to see
what happens when the server is queried in this state, but have no firm
conclusions.

I appreciate Paul Guyot's vote of confidence in my scripting skills, but
unfortunately this is not done by any SSI I wrote, but by tedious manual
labour!

All the more reason for one of us to develop an SSI that does this tedious
work for us!  However, I might be biting off more than I can chew, as I
did with my hopes of writing an SSI to automatically generate a reply to
anyone who posts on my Newton.

I for one cannot wait to see the revisions Paul plans on making to nHTTPd
once his Newton is back from vacation!

I thought is was a SSI because:
a/ you wrote several SSIs
b/ I think I read somewhere on your NPDS home page the expression 
"domain SSI" or something like that. Unfortunately, your Newton isn't 
up, so I cannot check.

Remind me to write you the SSI when I get my Newton back.

Would it be possible to come up with a central repository for all these
cool SSIs that people are writing?  I know Matt distributed some as a
"Scripties" package on both his NPDS page and AA Magazine, and Paul Filmer
has some on his Newton Web server.  Perhaps on the NPDS Developer releases
server with all the "parts" of the current NPDS we could have an SSI
folder with SSIs that people can choose to install on their Newtons.

Let's see if we can puzzle this one out (I'm also cc'ing this to the NPDS
mailing list).

If there is any way to configure your router so you have assigned IP
addresses, that's the easiest way to deal with trickier networking issues
like we have here.  For instance, in my old home network I assigned my
Newton the address 192.168.0.4.  That is a non-routing IP address:  the
router will not pass that IP address into the outside world.  The router
uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to route any requested information
from the real IP address to this non-routed IP address.

If you cannot turn off DHCP or would prefer not to, that's fine, too.  The
IP addresses that the DHCP server built into your router offers are
probably non-routing, too, and you'll find that your various computers
behind the router will tend to pick up the same IP addresses if you pay
attention over time.  

The big thing is that you have your router configured to allow information
on port 80 (or 8080) to be forwarded through the router to whatever
computer is serving web pages.  You probably shouldn't have multiple
servers running behind the router unless you can specifically configure
your NAT to forward to specific IP addresses (again, the need for fixed IP
addresses).

That done, you might have to go into your NPDS Tracker Client and specify
the IP address that you want your Newton to register with the Tracker. 
This would be the IP address assigned to you by your ISP (not the
DHCP-issued address for your Newton, nor the 192.168.x.x address, if you
assign one).  Since you're behind the router, probably using NAT, if you
bring NPDS up and register with the Tracker, the Newton will try to
register its assigned IP address, which in this case might be a non-routed
address.  Nobody can visit you if your IP address is 192.168.x.x or any of
the other non-routed IP addresses.

Even though you aren't running a huge server behind your router, keep in
mind @home doesn't want people running any servers on their cable lines.

I miss my Newton....
