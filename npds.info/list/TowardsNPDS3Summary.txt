Subject: [NPDS] Towards NPDS 3, let's summarize


Hi all,

First, even if there is that disconnecting bug (btw, it actually 
disables an endpoint), I consider that the new nHTTPd is stable 
enough to work as it for a while. So I can focus on NPDS 3.x.

I would like to summarize the features of NPDS 3.x. I had a colleague 
at INRIA who was convinced that HTTP-based personal data sharing for 
PDAs is the way to go. And in fact, he convinced me as well. So I 
would like to work towards Matt's initial idea, which is making NPDS 
a web interface for the data on the Newton, instead of stressing the 
pure web serving part which I was more interested it.

I think that NPDS shall allow us to view and modify data on the 
Newton. But not like on the Newton itself, it should rather be a 
publish mechanism with some update mechanisms whenever a keyboard and 
a big screen are more suitable than pen.

My problem with that was that I don't really want to publish my card 
file on the web. Some of us do it but I think that most don't. I 
don't want to publish my agenda either, etc.

Therefore we come to the core of NPDS features:
- it shall have a user login/logout interface that must be optional 
(guest mode). I hate it when I have to login on Apple's website. This 
means handling cookies. This also means that there should be 
permissions within the plug-ins. For example people in some group 
could see your card file and only you can modify it. This login thing 
will replace the Notes post/web pager identity.
- it shall have a website aspect that can be customized with themes. 
We can all customize the web pages but plug-ins shall be 
customizable. Using CSS might be sufficient, however it means that 
plug-ins must rely much more on CSSes. For that part, I wish the 
talented web designers on the list make some mock NPDS 3.x websites 
with various themes so the layman Newton user could just pick one in 
a popup. I think we discussed that already. I trust the CSS experts 
to tell me what should define a given theme.
- the notes server will be merged with works and splitted in several parts:
* web structure (including error documents, etc.) and themes notes 
(which could be in works) will be merged into the core module. They 
are always required. This also means that there will not be a default 
module on the contrary to 2.x. I don't think anyone doesn't use Notes 
as the default module. This module will include admin posting feature 
(i.e. something that let you add notes to the Newton with 
permissions).
* there could be a bulletin board module (replacing posting 
notes/listing of owner's notes).
* there should be a Wiki module.
* there might be a blog-like module.
- the gif server module shall be splitted in two parts:
* the gif encoder shall go into the core (and could be used to serve 
themes picture elements). I might add png and jpeg encoding.
* the screen module will display the screen content and let you (with 
permissions) click on it. Like VNC but via HTTP with authentication.
- the dates and card file modules shall let you modify/add entries
- the binary module will be merged into core because it is required 
for themes pictures.
- the tracker will stay as a separate module. Some people here don't 
use it and it's not because it brings instability, it's because they 
don't want/can't share their Newton.
- the watcher shall be merged into the core. The part that checks 
that NPDS is still serving is mainly a workaround for bugs. But it 
has two other interesting features that we might want to keep: (a) it 
restarts NPDS on reboot (except at Paul Filmer's) and (b) it reboots 
if the NS task seemed to crash (this can happen if some other 
software crashed it).
- there shall be some mechanism (probably HTTP based) to update pages 
and content remotely. This will go into Core.

So in the end, we'll have:
- Core
- BB
- Wiki
- Blog
- Screen
- Tracker
- Dates
- Card File
- Pager

What did I forget? Is there any feature that you would like to see?

And the next question: do you want to help and how?

I think it would be nice to be able to reply to a "Pager" message, like
invoking a form of instant messaging.

For example;
If I had my Newton running (the future) NPDS 3 and someone sent me a Pager"
message..

I would have the choice to dismiss the message window (like WebPager),
OR,
I could tap a "Reply" button (that might even load a third-party messaging
program, i.e. Chatbuddy, NewtCQ, NewtJabber etc.) and start a chat session.



I know that not everyone might want this type of functionality from NPDS 3,
but it's just my 2 cents!

Yes.  This would probably mean that the alternative messaging method would 
have to be sent along with the message, which means that the sender would 
have to have the info entered somewhere - most logically, in their owner's 
card.

I actually used to have something like this running on a webpage a long 
time ago.  I could send someone a webpager message from a special form I 
had (entering their IP address), and then when they replied they would go 
to another form (not on an NPDS server) where they could send an SMS in 
reply.

But this would mean that people who use Screen Shooter would have to keep 
an old version of GIF server around, or have NPDS core installed... or am 
I misunderstanding you?   Why not just make the GIF encoder a library like 
zlib?

Dates/Names should import/export vCalendar/vCard.

The tracker and the tracker server should also implement the stuff that 
we've dreamed about it doing: sending lon/lats for map graphing, possibly 
other cool stuff.  I forget now, it's been so long since we talked about 
it.  Maybe x-face images, for fun?

> What did I forget? Is there any feature that you would like to see?

Web*Pager could be so much cooler, as was already noted.  

> And the next question: do you want to help and how?

I mentioned the tracker stuff.  I'm not sure how else I can help...

In a previous message, Paul Guyot typed vigorously:

>What did I forget? Is there any feature that you would like to see?

I need more time to chew through all the options and possibilities, but I 
think we've already got about 90% of my wish list covered already.

>And the next question: do you want to help and how?

I've already mentioned in previous threads that I'd like to be involved 
in renovating the documentation, as well as designing a series of 
html/xhtml/css compliant templates or perhaps something called NPDS 
SiteSkins(tm).

In order to work on the latter, I'd like to start compiling a list of 
pages and web interfaces that each module would use, the various levels 
of information hierarchy on those pages, and so forth.

Oh, I'm so excited...

Sorry for this question that might seem dumb, but you mean that you 
prefer that to Wiki or you want to run it on Wiki?

Oh yeah, I forgot Screen Shooter. 'Kay, it should be a library-like 
separate module. I'll have to discuss with Daniel.
(and the png encoder will actually be part of the ZLib because of 
their relationship).

Noted.

Great, a new dream-like idea for the tracker: x-faces.

>Web*Pager could be so much cooler, as was already noted.

Yes. In fact, we discussed about these improvements a while back on that list.

Indeed, this is what to start with. Please don't forget error pages 
(with permissions, we'll have at least 404, 403 and 500). Everything 
should wear the SiteSkin.

>Oh, I'm so excited...

All that is reasonable. Nobody asked for PHP support yet.
