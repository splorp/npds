<H1>The Register Program</H1>

<P>Saying "Thank-You" is fairly simple. Open the Register program
that accompanies My Program. Enter your name, your email address, and
request either the Single-User license or Request a License plus
Manual and Disks.

<P>Save or Copy or Print the data from the Register program and send
the data and payment to Kagi. More specifics on the Register program
to follow. Kagi handles my payment processing.

<P>If paying with Credit Card or First Virtual, you can email or fax
the data to Kagi. Their email address is sales@kagi.com and their fax
number is +1 510 652-6589. You can either Copy the data from Register
and paste into the body of an email message or you can Save the data
to a file and you can attach that file to an email message. There is
no need to compress the data file, it's already pretty small. If you
have a fax modem, just Print the data to the Kagi fax number.

<P>Payments sent via email are processed within 3 to 4 days. You will
receive an email acknowledgement when it is processed. Payments sent
via fax take up to 10 days and if you provide a correct internet
email address you will receive an email acknowledgement.

<P>If you are paying with Cash or USD Check you should print the data
using the Register application and send it to the address shown on
the form, which is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Kagi 1442-A<BR>
   Walnut Street #392-S7U<BR>
   Berkeley, California 94709-1405<BR>
   USA</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can donate using a wide variety of cash from different
countries but at present if you donate via check, it must be a check
drawn in US Dollars. Kagi cannot accept checks in other currencies,
the conversion rate for non-USD checks is around USD 15 per check and
that is just not practical. If you have a purchasing department, you
can enter all the data into the Register program and then select
Invoice as your donation method. Print three copies of the form and
send it to your accounts payable people. You might want to highlight
the line that mentions that they must include a copy of the form with
their donation. Kagi can not invoice your company, you need to act on
my behalf and generate the invoice and handle all the paperwork on
your end. Please do not fax or email payment forms that indicate
Cash, Check or Invoice as the donation method. As far as we know,
there is still no technology to transfer physical objects via fax or
email and without the payment, the form cannot be processed.
Donations sent via postal mail take time to reach Kagi and then up to
10 days for processing. 

<P><I>Again, if you include a correct email address, you will hear
from Kagi when the form is processed.</I>

<P>If you do not have an email address, please enter your complete
postal address and please remember, we do not know what country you
live in so please enter that into the postal address also.
