<H1>The NPDS Pseudo-Filename System</H1>

<P><I>How To Be a Card-Based Computer in a Disk-Based World</I>

<P>The Web is very much organized around the idea of "files" and
"paths" and "directories" yet the Newton has no concept of these
things. All storage on a Newton is in a single meta-store and divided
into smaller units called soups. Soups are composed of entries. The
Newton paradigm is much more fluid and adaptive than the fixed
directory sructure of standard CLI -type filesystems but since we're
trying to emulate the latter, some conventions have been established.

<P>Newton Data is accessed via directories like in a standard
filesystem, but NPDS uses the folder name (/dates/, /html/, etc) to
determine which plugin to use to create data for service to the WWW.
No physical information is encoded in the directory name.

<P>Thusly: All NPDS Directories are one level deep. In other words,
by default, all items in the /dates/ directory are the same level in
the tree. There's no support for additional layers in the emulated
filesystem and developers are welcome to use any subdirectory scheme
they wish to implement.

<P>NPDS paths look like: "<B>/html/224567867$967.xxx</B>"

<P>What is encoded here is:

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><CODE>|NPDSPluginPath|/|NewtonStoreSignature|$|SoupEntryUniqueID|optionaldata|.|extension|</CODE></FONT>

<P>This path, combining the directory, store, soup entry ID, and
extension allow NPDS plugins to return the requested item just like
it was being served off a big ol' Hard Disk.
