<H1>The NPDS Cascading Style Sheet</H1>

<P>New in this version of NPDS is a revamped HTML engine that
generates nearly perfect HTML 4.0 code. A new paradigm in
presentation of web content is to send the information <I>separate
from </I>the formatting. This allows immense flexibility on the part
of the author, the server, and the browser in the way content is
presented.

<P>All the font and style information has been stripped from the HTML
created by NPDS. This data is now expected to be contained in a
Cascading Style Sheet, which is a declaration of how the various
elements of a page should be rendered. A definitive reference on
style sheets can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Styles/" TARGET="_blank">W3
web site</A> but I'll briefly describe what this means to you in the
rest of this section.

<H2>A Basic Style Sheet</H2>

<P>A typical style sheet looks something like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#003399"><CODE>&lt;STYLE
   TYPE="text/css"&gt;</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#003300"><CODE>&lt;!--</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>BODY {</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>BACKGROUND-COLOR:
   #ffffff;</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>FONT-FAMILY: Chicago,
   sans-serif;</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>FONT-SIZE:
   MEDIUM}</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>EM { FONT-STYLE: italic
   }</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>H1 { FONT-SIZE: X-LARGE,
   </CODE></FONT>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>BACKGROUND-COLOR:
      #66cc99, </CODE></FONT>
      
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>FONT-FAMILY: Charcoal
      }</CODE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>H2 { FONT-SIZE: LARGE
   }</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>STRONG { FONT-WEIGHT:
   bold }</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>TD.HILITE {
   BACKGROUND-COLOR: #dddddd }</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#660000"><CODE>CODE { FONT-FAMILY:
   Courier, monospace }</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#003300"><CODE>--&gt;</CODE></FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#003399"><CODE>&lt;/STYLE&gt;</CODE></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can have this data inline within the web page or it can be
imported as a separate file. If you view the source of a NPDS web
page, you'll see our style sheet up in the HEADer region of the
source. This style sheet is inserted into all HTML generated by NPDS
(if this function is turned on).

<P>The power of this approach, you may be able to see is that all
instances of say, H1, will have a large font, a background color of
light green, and be rendered in the font face "Charcoal". Note also
the TD.HILITE element: this is a special class of the TD element that
has a colored background. I actually use this element to highlight
the elements in DateServ.

<P>NPDS extends this power by using the formatting Server Side
Includes in its default style sheet. This way, the style sheet can be
re-written by either hand-coding it or more easily, by interacting
with the NPDS Setup application.

<H2>Editing or Configuring Use of the Style Sheet</H2>

<P>Under the Content tab of the nHTTPd Preference application, you'll
find two controls for the Style Sheet. You can turn Style Sheets on
or off if you wish and you can also open a window in which you can
edit the style sheet used by NPDS.

<H3>The Style Sheet Editor</H3>

<P>The CSS editor is a floating window that you can scroll around in.
Three buttons adorn the bottom of the window:

<OL>
   <LI><B>Default:</B> Restore the Style Sheet to the built-in
   default</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Revert:</B> Erase all changes you have made since the last
   time you saved the Style Sheet</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Save:</B> Finalize Changes you've made to the Style
   Sheet.</LI>
</OL>

<P>If you are editing the style sheet with NPDS still running, make
sure to tap the <B>Apply </B>button in the main NPDS Setup
application in order to load the new style sheet into NPDS' memory.

<H2>Browser Support for Cascading Style Sheets</H2>

<P>Ironically, our NPDS servers are more compliant with W3 standards
than are a siginificant fraction of desktop or handheld WWW browsers.
Versions of Navigator before 4.x can't understand them and the
implementation under MSIE 3.x was buggy and inconsistent. Mileage may
vary with other browsers. Therefore, NPDS detects whether a user is
visiting with a CSS-enabled browser and will NOT transmit the CSS
data if the browser is too old to understand it. 

<P>As of this version of NPDS, MSIE 4.x, 5.x, and Mozilla 4.x are
considered CSS-enabled and are sent the data. If you use another
browser that is truly CSS compliant, please email me the User Agent
field for it and I'll add it to the list of enabled browsers.
