<P>Web*Pager brings AOL and ICQ style instant messenging to the
Newton. Visitors to your NPDS server can send you a "Page" which will
pop up in this pager-type applet on your Newton.

<P>The backlight will flash, a tone will sound, and then, if you have
Macintalk installed, the message will be <B>SPOKEN OUT LOUD!!! </B>

<P>You can also respond to <I>some</I> pages sent from other Newtons.

<P><B>Interface:</B>

<P>In the screenshot on the right, the buttons along the bottom of
the "Pager" are info, Delete, Back, Forward, Save, Reply, Close.

<P>You can also scroll up and down in a Page as well as select and
copy Page text to the Clipboard.

<P><B>Two Way Paging</B>

<P>Note the Newt Button next to the Save icon in the screenshot. This
button appears when the sender of the page is using a Newton Browser.

<P>The assumption is that he/she is also running NPDS. If you tap the
Newt Button, your browser will launch and access the sender's copy of
Web*Pager via NPDS. Voila, you can reply to the message from your
browser. I know this is a hack, but it's the best I can do for
freeware! I am working on pager clients for MacOS and (maybe) Win32
and information on these will become available later.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>urlCop</B>: Don't forget to install urlCop or two-way
   paging won't work. For those of you who don't know, urlCop is
   somewhat like Internet Config for the Mac. It provides a
   system-level URL handler.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Configuring Web*Pager</H4>

<P>The option to speak or not speak is controlled by an entry you'll
find under Web*Pager's <B>info button</B> since some of you will not
want a chatty Newton...
