<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A NAME=Sorry></A>Apologies for
Arcanity</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">What you're about to see is arcane and may
look to you like I have ported DOS to the Newton. But a lot of you
have asked me how to make links between objects under NPDS so I am
going to show you how I would do it. We'll use an example from which
you can abstract what you wish.</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A NAME=vCard></A>Creating a link to YOUR
vCard</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">When you move your cursor over a link to NPDS
data, you see a long, seemingly nonsensical URL. However, it's not
quite the gibberish it seems to be. I developed a standard reference
scheme for retrieving soup entries and the data required for this
process is encoded within the URL. If I were to do a search for "Joe"
on my Newton's Cardfile, I'd get 3 cards with links to the following
6 "files"</FONT>

<P><CODE>/cards/2230468$7.vcd, /cards/2230468$7.htm</CODE>

<P><CODE>/cards/2230468$45.vcd, /cards/2230468$45.htm</CODE>

<P><CODE>/cards/-336767$10.vcd, /cards/-336767$10.htm</CODE>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If you examine these filenames, you can see
the pseudo directory "cards" specifies what plugin handles tis
request and within the actual filename part, you see a large number
separated by a $ from a smaller number. These values represent the
identity of the RAM (internal or card) device where this entry is
found and the unique Newton soup ID code which is always an integer,
respectively. An extension is appended ".htm" or ".vcd" and as you
can guess, I make use of extensions to help specify how NPDS should
display this entry. When possible, I try to map the extension to a
standard Windows file extension.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">These values are static unless you re-file
the original reference, in which case the store ID would change. What
this means is that you can link directly to any soup entry that we
support under NPDS.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To illustrate this, let's over-ride the
built-in USR_NAME server-side include with one that not only returns
your name but a link to your vCard. To get your own vCard URI
address, you need to fire up your server and do a search for your own
name. Copy the link location of your vCard and verify that you
<U>can</U> retrieve your vCard by entering that URI into the Location
field of your browser. Now begins the fun..</FONT>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">

         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>local theOut:= "";</CODE>
            
            <P><CODE>local theName:= GetUserConfig('name);</CODE>
            
            <P><CODE>local vCard:= "/cards/8675309$4.vcd";</CODE>
            
            <P><CODE>return "&lt;A TARGET = \"_blank\" HREF=\""
            </CODE>
            
            <P><CODE>&amp; vCard &amp; "&gt;" &amp; theName &amp;
            "&lt;/A&gt;";</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

      </TD>
   </TR>
</TABLE>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">OK. We're done. It was that easy. If you want
to stop over-riding the built-in USR_NAME tag, turn this script off.
If you want to return the HTML version of your name card, change the
end of the URI from ".vcd" to ".htm".</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">There is, of course, a problem with this
simple script. If you change owner cards, the vCard link won't point
to the right person. You could add some code to catch different User
Names and return the appropriate vCard link but you're on your own
for that one.</FONT>
