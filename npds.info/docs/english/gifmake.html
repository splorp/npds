is a Newton extension that allows you to create GIF images of all or
part of the Newton screen. By using GIFServe you can make your
Newton-based web page unique! Once you are serving GIFs from your
Newton, you can save the GIFs in your desktop browser using the usual
Save Image command.

<P>With GIFMaker, you can set the foreground and background colors by
tapping on the GIFMaker icon in the Extensions folder of the Extras
Drawer. A set of sliders for Red, Green, and Blue for each of
foreground and background are provided. The default is black images
on a white background.
