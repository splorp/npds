         Sharing is a moving target.. no sooner than I can release a
         version are feature requests, suggestions, bug fixes, and
         innovative ideas pouring into my mailbox. Since you've shown
         more than average support for NPDS Development, I've decided
         to write </FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Impact"><B>4&#149;AA</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">,
         a semi-monthly webzine in place of the "NPDS Cookbook" which
         was just WAY too static for anyone's tastes. I can get the
         latest dirt out to you much more easily than if I try to put
         out monolithic releases every once in a while.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>T</B>hose of you who registered
         early on, please accept my most humble apologies for the
         delay in getting this rolling. Between NPDS bugs and my
         scientific career, I have been one busy boy. Now that the
         public knows about NPDS 2.0x, we'll be much more on track
         now.</FONT>

         </FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Impact"><B>4&#149;AA</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">,
         I'll show you the neatest things about NPDS.. stuff that
         other people don't know about or ideas nobody else has yet
         come up with. We're also going to try to meet some of the
         users of NPDS and find out how they use their Newton Server
         in their everyday lives. Also, you'll get the inside scoop
         on bugs, fixes, and have early access to new versions of
         NPDS components as I write them. Finally, for the
         programmers out there, we're going to, over the next few
         issues, walk through writing your own NPDS plugin for the
         Calls application.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>I</B> am looking for
         contributions to this 'zine from anyone who feels inclined..
         I'll publish just about anything provided its of good
         quality and accurate, so if you'd like to write for us, let
         me know ASAP! Nothing ever gets done by sitting on one's
         hands :-)</FONT>
