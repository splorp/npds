Distribution</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">If all goes well and NPDS takes off in the
remaining Newton community, perhaps we'll see a trade in neat scripts
that run under the NPDS SSA. In order to facilitate this, I have made
it pretty easy to roll a script you write into a script package like
the ones that come with this issue of </FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Impact"><B>4&#149;AA</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">,.
All you need is a a copy of the Newton Toolkit for Mac or Windows and
a good script. Go install NTK if you have not already, learn how to
connect the Inspector to your Newton, then come back to this
page.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">OK. You're back. Download the proper NTK
Project (</FONT><A HREF="downloads/NTKMAC.hqx"><FONT FACE="Verdana">Mac</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">
| </FONT><A HREF="downloads/NTKWIN.ZIP"><FONT FACE="Verdana">Windows</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">)
and decompress it. Make a copy of this folder on your desktop. Now
connect your Newton to the NTK Inspector and open the NPDS script
editor. Flip through the list of scripts until you get to the one you
want to share.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">In the inspector, type "</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">GetRoot().|Editor:MAVON|:ScriptToInspector();</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">"
and hit ENTER (not return). You'll get a text dump of your script
file. Copy and paste this into a decent text editor. I use BBEdit on
the Macintosh and I am sure there's a good one on the PC end of
things. You need to search and replace every quotation mark <B>"</B>
with a backslash-quotation mark <B>"\ </B>This is because the
quotation mark is a special character under Newtonscript.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Switch back to NTK and open the copy of the
<B>project file</B> you made on the desktop. You'll get a window with
the source file listed in it. Double-click on the source file and
you'll see the following text inside it:</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>local script:= </CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>{name: "Script Name",</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>active: TRUE,</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>static: NIL,</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>ssitag: "SSI",</CODE>
   
   <P><CODE>text: ""};</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Edit the <B>name </B>to be the name of your
script as it shows in the Script Editor's Info line, assign a SSI tag
to this script, and then switch to your text editor. Copy the altered
script text and paste it between the quotation marks of the <B>text
</B>slot. Now save in case something goes awry.</FONT>

<P><IMG SRC="images/pkg.GIF" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="Verdana">To
create your script package, choose build package from the Project
menu of NTK. A package will appear in the Script Template folder. You
can now go and rename the package to whatever you wish.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To test the installability of your new
script, choose "Install Package" from the Project Menu. You'll get a
dialog on your Newton informing you of your success. Some warning is
in order here as you will now have two copies of the same script in
your Script Soup. This can have unanticipated results. Delete one as
soon as you are sure this whole process worked.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Happy Scripting and I hope to see some cool
scripts!</FONT>
