<P>Please Read and Accept/Do Not Accept This License</P>

<P>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</P>

<P>Version 2, June 1991</P>

<P>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675
Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA</P>

<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble
The licenses for most software<BR>
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share<BR>
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
all its users. This General Public License applies to most of
the Free Software Foundation's<BR>
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using
it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General<BR>
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</P>

<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to<BR>
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the<BR>
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.</P>

<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions<BR>
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>

<P>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make<BR>
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.</P>

<P>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to copy, distribute and/or<BR>
modify the software.</P>

<P>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software<BR>
is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others<BR>
will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</P>

<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually<BR>
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use<BR>
or not licensed at all.</P>

<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR<BR>
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</P>

<P>0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of<BR>
this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers
to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any<BR>
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated<BR>
into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee
is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</P>

<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The
act of running the Program is not<BR>
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of having been made by<BR>
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.</P>

<P>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and<BR>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
to this License and to the<BR>
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</P>

<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.</P>

<P>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
and distribute such<BR>
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>

<P>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</P>

<P>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
or any part thereof, to be licensed<BR>
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.</P>

<P>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most<BR>
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
(or else, saying that you<BR>
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
of this License. (Exception: if<BR>
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
to print an announcement.)<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can
be reasonably<BR>
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate<BR>
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms<BR>
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it.</P>

<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the intent is to exercise the right to control<BR>
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Program.</P>

<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or<BR>
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License.</P>

<P>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2<BR>
above provided that you also do one of the following:</P>

<P>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a<BR>
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>

<P>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source<BR>
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium<BR>
customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>

<P>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
is allowed only for noncommercial<BR>
distribution and only if you received the program in object code
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
b above.)</P>

<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the<BR>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the<BR>
executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form)<BR>
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the<BR>
executable.</P>

<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code<BR>
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code. 4.<BR>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify,<BR>
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or<BR>
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</P>

<P>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Program<BR>
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any<BR>
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the<BR>
Program or works based on it.</P>

<P>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy,<BR>
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights<BR>
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License.</P>

<P>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on<BR>
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.<BR>
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may<BR>
not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies<BR>
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program.</P>

<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply and the section<BR>
as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</P>

<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has<BR>
the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the<BR>
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</P>

<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution
and/or use of the<BR>
Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or
by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
the Program under this<BR>
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
in or among countries not thus<BR>
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
as if written in the body of this License.</P>

<P>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar<BR>
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</P>

<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and &quot;any later version&quot;,<BR>
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the<BR>
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>

<P>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for<BR>
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for<BR>
this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of<BR>
software generally.</P>

<P>NO WARRANTY</P>

<P>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT<BR>
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER<BR>
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT<BR>
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK<BR>
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>

<P>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY<BR>
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE<BR>
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED<BR>
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR<BR>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>

<P>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>
