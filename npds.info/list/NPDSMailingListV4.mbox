Subject: [NPDS] Thoughts around an NPDS tagline?
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2003 21:19:16 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

I'm starting to think we need a catchier tagline for the NPDS site. The 
current one is just something I spat out while in the throws of tweaking 
and editing the existing NPDS home page.

     "Putting a web server in the palm of your hand."

It's a bit bland, if you ask me.

Matt used the phrase "Serve different." on the original NPDS 
documentation pages, but this is really just a continuation of the old 
Maxum Development program back in the mid-90's evangelizing the running 
of Mac-based web servers.

     http://tinyurl.com/513v

We need our own thing. Something that will not only look good as the 
tagline for the website, but something that will look equally stunning 
(not to mention intelligent) on a t-shirt, for example.

How about...

     "Yes, that is a web server in my pocket."

Any other bright ideas?

   I like it..  When was NPDS's first version done?  How about, "Serve a 
webpage from the palm of hand..  In 1998 (or whatever)."  This would 
only work really well if the date was before Palm came out (at least 
before any webserver for Palm came out, if there even is one).  In any 
case, it might be a little obscure.  It would be nicer if you could say 
"Serve a webpage from inside your pocket.  In 1998."  Except that the 
WaveLan driver didn't come along until recently (I assume NPDS will 
work over WaveLan).  But anyway, "Serve a webpage from inside your 
pocket" would be good with the 'inside' in italics.

Hey Dan.

I've updated the URLs on the NPDS development site. Thank you.

By the way, there seems to be a bunch of broken images on your tracker 
page. Did you remove images from your www.mymacs.com server?

Great.

Could you please update your .ini file to tell your tracker to share 
records with (i.e. to go and retrieve records from) 
npds-tracker.continuity.cx, port 3680 instead of shakti.continuity.cx 
port 2110 as it currently does?

Thanks. Shakti is expected to be shut down soon.

Subject: [NPDS] XML-RPC and POST with NPDS
From: Adam Tow <nospam_adam_at_tow_dot_com>

Everyone:

I'm working on an XML-RPC Client/Server for the Newton that I'd like to 
interface with NPDS. Does NPDS support receiving POST requests? Where's 
the best place to look for documentation on the plug-in architecture of 
NPDS modules? I looked over the npds.ml.free site but couldn't find 
anything there other than the source code to the modules? If there 
isn't any documentation, I'll start pouring over modifying one of the 
existing modules.

In the meantime, the application currently can encode and decode 
NewtonScript objects  and XML blobs formatted for XML-RPC calls. The 
next step is to make the application install a routing transport for 
easy transmission of XML-RPC calls over the Internet. Should be pretty 
cool :)

There's definitely nothing that specific in the documentation that was 
posted from Matt's
original site. Maybe he has some inside information. My guess is that 
Paul will be a source.

Paul and I started working on this under the project name of nBlogger. It 
shows up as a routing option, but that's about it.

Hey Matt...

I'm sure that I paid my Kagi donation way back (if I didn't actually pay 
it and just plain forgot, my sincere apologies...), but I never received 
the infamous NPDS Cookbook that you mention here:

http://npds.free.fr/docs/english/donation.html

Does this document still exist? If it does, would you mind if we posted 
it to the development site?

Cheers.

The static 'NPDS cookbook' became '4AA magazine'. Originally, it was
going to run quarterly and feature advanced scripting news, cutting
edge development builds of NPDS, and profiles of NPDS users, and
anything else we could toss in. But I couldn't get contributors and I
also started getting a lot of pressure from my advisor to focus on my
Ph.D. work, so it only ran for an issue.

You can find Issue 1 at

Unless Paul has implemented it, NPDS does not explicitly support POST.
I know, it should in order to be HTTP 1.0 compliant, but I was just
never able to implement it. As for the plugin architecture, the best
thing to do it rip the code from one apart and ask me questions as you
go. I suggest the Card or Name servers as they are both substantially
simpler than the Notepad server, yet they use all the standard
interfaces. Back in the day, I had a template for modules that I
distributed that was better documented, but I can't seem to find it
(that was 4 computers ago so perhaps it has been lost in the bitbin of
history).

Here's a VERY brief overview of the module architecture...

http://genetrap.cshl.org/~vaughn/NPDS/4AAMagazine/npdsintro.html

The Calls plugin was never written explicitly as a module. Instead, I
implemented it at a user group meeting one evening using the scripting
architecture to demonstrate the power of dynamically executed
Newtonscript.

Plus I always forget how to do that nicely. Or maybe that old copy of

Thanks for the link Matt. I seem to recall seeing it in amongst the news 
items on your old Lightyear NPDS site. Good to see that you've still got 
all the Lightyear bits around too. I'll post a copy of 4AA on the 
development site as part of the additional resources.

Subject: [NPDS] Base64 Encoder/Decoder?
From: Adam Tow <nospam_adam_at_tow_dot_com>

Is there a library for the Newton that performs Base64 Encoding and 
Decoding? I want to be able to convert binary objects (like packages) 
into Base64 for transmission via my XML-RPC Transport.

Thanks.

If you find one or write one, please let the group know. If i recall, 
implementing POST support in NPDS will require the ability to decode a 
Base64 stream. This may have been one the stumbling blocks that kept me 
from implementing it.

I don't know if this will help you out Adam, but there's this C library 
for Base64 that was ported to UserLand Frontier and HyperCard:

     http://www.scripting.com/midas/base64/

Interestingly enough, LunaSuite did Base64 email and the source code is 
available for tinkering.

Subject: [NPDS] nBlog, XML-RPC, and nHTML -- 1/6/2003
From: Adam Tow <nospam_adam_at_tow_dot_com>

Everyone:

[ this message has also been cross-posted to the Newtontalk mailing 
list ]

Happy New Year to all Newton owners around the world. 2003 is shaping 
up to be a very green year!

I noticed a thread on the list for people trying to organize a Newton 
gathering at MacWorld SF this week. I've posted a poll on my website 
forums:

	http://www.tow.com/forums/

under Newton->General->MacWorld Gathering Poll. If you are planning on 
attending, please cast your vote for what day(s) you want to meet and 
watch for future announcements on the exact time and location.

As many of you know from reading the list, I've been working this past 
month on some exciting new applications for the Newton, including:

1) nHTML 2.0: nHTML is the most powerful, portable web editing tool. 
nHTML lets you create tags, dialog boxes, popups, and scripts to make 
your web development experience more efficient and productive.

2) XML-RPC for the Newton: A unit (i.e. shared library) that implements 
an XML-RPC client on the Newton. The package allows third-party 
developers to send and receive remote procedure calls over the 
Internet. It also installs a system-wide transport that lets the user 
send virtually any Newton soup object over the Internet, such as a 
Name, Date, Note (and in the future, a package!).

3) nBlog: An application that makes use of XML-RPC and nHTML that 
allows a user with a Newton connected to the Internet to update a blog 
in real-time. If you're wirelessly connected (think showfloor at 
MacWorld), you can update your web site instantly!

You can get a sneak peak at three of them on my temporary weblog:

	http://www.tow.com/weblog/

If you are interested in using nBlog, XML-RPC, and nHTML during 
MacWorld, please contact me. I'm looking to creating a community weblog 
for the duration of the MacWorld conference.

Adam,

A happy new year from over the great pond to you too.
I'm looking forward to all those great Newton projects.
 
With the purchase of an ethernetcard last week, I started exploring NPDS.
After all those years of using my mp21k, NPDS opened up yet another
fascinating world of this gem !
Just waiting for a backup-restore and package installer tool on MacOSX over
ethernet to make it complete.

Subject: [NPDS] Someone crashed my NPDS server...

...while it was plugged to Hammer!
(I was finalizing my port of TidyLib).

Apparently, it crashed in the debug code of the GIFLib.
It displayed the Proto error dialog with a big number (normal since 
it crashed with a bus error).

After all, the only suspect native code that is executed in NPDS at 
the moment (only native code can generate bus errors) is the GIFLib 
and NIE.

I've removed the debug code, so we'll see if the error happens again.

The new package is on the NPDS website.

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] NPDS Network Setup How-To

Hi folks,

I've written a documentation explaining how to setup the NPDS in a 
private LAN context.
It is available here:
http://npds.free.fr/docs/new/NPDS-Network-Setup-How-To.html

Oh, I just realized I didn't mention that one can do the trick with 
an Apache server instead of a regular router, since an NPDS user did 
this in the past. But this requires extended Apache knowledge anyway.

[I hope it is clear enough to help you Karl-Heinz. Your last mistake, 
if I understood properly, was to use the router's private IP.]

Could you please comment on this and complete it with screen shots 
and explanations for your own router hardware/software? This is the 
most difficult part when using NPDS and unfortunately, we cannot 
really simplify it.

I hope I haven't made too many mistakes. Grant, would you agree to be 
responsible for editing this how-to page? Also, feel free to move it 
anywhere on the website, of course.

Regards,

Paul

Nicolas showed the way and sent me the setup details for his NetBSD router.

So I've updated the page.

Yes, I will play editor and mover for these types of articles. I'll

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Tracker move

Hi folks,

Shakti tracker will soon no longer be shakti tracker (it's moving to 
another box, just like NewtonTalk if ever you wonder).

So please update your bookmarks and tracker servers/clients by changing:
shakti.continuity.cx
by
npds-tracker.continuity.cx

The full URL is:
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:2110

Port 8080 also works.
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:8080

For some reasons related to the new server, I'll update the tracker 
server code in the next days.

Thanks.

Paul

		[NPDS] [ANN] Newton Tracker Official Port Number

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Newton Tracker Official Port Number

Hi folks,

IANA gave us an official port number for NPDS tracker server. It's 3680.

Please update your tracker server and tracker client accordingly.

If ever you use shakti, let me remind you the URL:
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:3680/

Put npds-tracker.continuity.cx into the server and 3680 into both ports.
Continuity tracker also listens on 2110 and 8080. I'll disable 2110 
at some point.

There will be a new version of the tracker server that defaults to port 3680.
We also got udp although I didn't ask for it.

Also, if ever you want to add it to your /etc/services file, the 
official name is npds-tracker (comment is NPDS Tracker).

Regards,

Paul

Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2003 21:38:10 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Well, I've finally started tweaking a few things over at the NPDS 
development site. The look and feel haven't changed much (yet), but lot 
of things have been tuned up under the hood. I've created a changelog on 
the site if you feel the need to keep tabs on what's changing:

     http://npds.free.fr/changelog.txt

Since Paul Guyot has graciously handed over the keys to the car, there'll 
be more improvements coming soon. Please let me know if you find anything 
out of place or would like to have documents added to the site.

*** Note: I am going to be standardizing all of the directory names and 
removing the superfluous spaces. If you've previously linked to specific 
module directories, these will be changing in the near future.

Stay tuned.

Subject: [NPDS] Yoichi Takezawa's NPDS Uni Branch
Date: Mon, 20 Jan 2003 21:41:42 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

I've managed to locate copies of Yoichi Takezawa's pages for his 
Unicode-based branch of the NPDS code. I already had copies of the 
packages and his version of the source code, but the mac.com-hosted pages 
were hosed by Apple a while ago and proved hard to find in the bowels of 
the Internet Archive.

Since I have not been able to contact Yoichi, I am going to go ahead and 
tidy up his Japanese version of the pages and then Babelfish an 
Engrish-manglation of the information. Both of these pages, plus copies 
of the source and packages will be posted to the NPDS site sometime this 
week. I think it is within our mandate to make sure that this information 
gets archived.

NPDS Uni also requires Makoto Nukui's (GNUE) Japenese Encoding packages 
based on the NTEncoding SDK. GNUE and his site have also disappeared, so 
I think it would be beneficial to mirror those related files as well.

For those not familiar with the work that Yoichi did on NPDS Uni, some of 
the new features are:

* Browse, search and post to Notepad in Japanese.
* Browse and search Names in Japanese.
* Browse Dates in Japanese.
* Post to Names.
* Post to Newton Works.

I'll notify the list when this information is available on the NPDS site. 
Naturally, any and all comments are welcome.

Oh, nevermind...

I found GNUE's relocated site with all of his NTEncoding stuff:

     http://www.geocities.jp/gnue_x/

Pardon me, while I think out loud during the redesign.

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Continuity NPDS tracker move

Hi folks,

I'm pleased to announce that Continuity NPDS tracker is moving.
The URL is:
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:3680/

For a while, both the old tracker and the new one will be running. I 
guess it will be the case until the old box is shut down.
They're both setup to share their own records. No need to register on both.

The TTL is quite big but NIE doesn't see TTLs smaller than one day 
anyway (and there is a bug that makes it 60 days, it can be fixed 
with my NIE patch).

Until the name propagates (and afterwards), you can use the IP. It's 
64.141.71.230.
The port is 3680. There is an alternate port for firewalled browser, 8080.

The old port, 2110, is not supported.

I'll make a screen shot of my configuration tomorrow and maybe an 
update of the tracker server software.

BTW, if you're running an NPDS tracker (hint hint), please update the 
configuration so it accesses npds-tracker.continuity.cx (or 
64.141.71.230) on port 3680.

Since the IANA saw fit to give us our own TCP port, I've moved the misato 
tracker onto this port as well as upgrading to the latest tracker server 
version (0.1.31).

Grant, if you could make this minor change to the NPDS home page that would be 
peachy.

Everyone, change your tracker clients to connect to port 3680!

Done. I also added a link to the official IANA port numbers document and 
mentioned the alternate 8080 port number for the Continuity tracker. (See 
the site change log)

Does Misato run on 8080 as well?

What about updating the template.html page so it refers to 
npds-tracker.continuity.cx instead of shakti.continuity.cx?

You don't need to restart the tracker for that purpose.

Oops, sorry for the confusion... I meant mymacs.net

Looks like everything is back working now.

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS list archives -> hypermail?
Date: Thu, 30 Jan 2003 19:47:37 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Hey boys.

Would it be possible to run Paul's .mbox archives of the NPDS list 
through hypermail, so I could post an HTML version of the list archives? 
I'd try to do this myself on my Qube, but I'm already up to my elbows in 
UBB upgrades, CPAN config, DB_File installation and noddling with Movable 
Type.

Is there a way to automate a hypermail archive, like we have for 
NewtonTalk?

We should be able to convert from archive to individual messages. I know 
I can do that through Emailer. It's just that Emailer doesn't import 
.mbox format directly.

The only reason I brought this up is that the .mbox formatted archives 
aren't that readily usable by folks wanting to extract a specific bit of 
wisdom out of the data.

I have every message (as far as I can tell) since October 10, 2002. In 
case we need to do a compare against yours...

Maybe we should look into this too.

Hey all & Grant,

What about putting all the known/used SSI scripts up on the NPDS developmen=

site?

For example, the client, package listing, backlight and etc from Paul
Filmer, Matt Vaughn

something pointing to the documentation on the site to help people get them

What are your thoughts, everyone?

Hey John.

Well, I think it's a dandy idea.

I'll set up a /scripts/ directory on the site which will list any 
available SSI scripts (and versions thereof) including a little 
description of how each works. Additionally, it would make sense to link 
to the SSI documentation and a short tutorial on using the NPDS Script 
Editor.

Why don't we start by everyone sending me their favorite scripts (or 
hacked version of existing scripts) and I'll start compiling them.

I know Paul Filmer has a small stash of scripts on his NPDS server. Maybe 
we could use that as jumping off point?

My thoughts exactly! Paul has done a good job of using/keeping up with them.


Do you want me to send you the scripts off of Paul's site in text format?

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] NPDS Protocol Document edited and updated
Date: Mon, 3 Mar 2003 21:37:14 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Please note that during my gradual clean up of the NPDS site, I have been 
lightly editing documents that exist within the source code directories. 
My latest victim  was the NPDS_Protocol_1.1.html document, currently 
found in the Tracker Server directory. If you folks intend on updating 
this document, please use my edited and freshly formatted version as the 
master. Specific points regarding my editing can be viewed in the 
changelog.

http://npds.free.fr/changelog.txt

*** Fair Warning ***

Upcoming changes to the NPDS site include:

* Moving all module directories into their own subdirectory
* Creation of an index page specifically for the modules
* Creation of an index page for all documentation
* Addition of the NPDSU source and binaries
* Standardized naming conventions for all site directories
* Standardized naming conventions for all read me files
* Conversion of mailing list .mbox archives to something more usable
* Addition of a personalizable style sheet to the raw html we have now
* Much, much more...

I have a dyndns acct set up for my G4, which is alice.dyndns.info

I'm connecting my Newton 130 over a null-modem connection to the G4, 
and want to run an NPDS server at toves.alice.dyndns.info

Is there anything strange I need to do to Apache, or my PPPD script or 
anything else to make my newt accessible this way?

PS: Toves is the name of my 130... bonus points to the first person to 
figure out where the name's from, Hint: it's related to my email addy

Hi gang.

I manually deleted my NPDS log soup the other day, and now NPDS won't 
create a new one. I've tried turning logging off and on again several 
times, but to no avail. This is a very curious happening. Any suggestions 
on how to get my server log back up and running?

It'd sure be nice to be able to write the log to notepad or works, 
wouldn't it?

Oh good, I though it was just me or something I did.

That explains why there was a couple of entries in my log prior to me 
deleting the store. I assumed that it was working, but not recording 
everything.

Ok, so these scripts will export the current log data (up to several 
dozens entries I suppose) to a note. that's a good start. But what would 
be more useful for server traffic analysis would be to incrementally 
append each hit or log entry to to the same note. Additionally you could 
"roll the log file" to a new note every day or after so many hits.

Just a thought.

Maybe it's just me, but I like looking at server log data.

Thanks Paul.

From: "Gregory Gee" <nospam_newton_at_gee.homeip_dot_net>


  Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I am still fairly new
to Newton and very new to NPDS.

1. I have seen a few sites that have NPDS and gifServer running and
   was wondering how they are getting the screen shots of there Newton
   to be greyscale instead of greenscale such http://65.84.243.167/screen.

2. This isn't really NPDS related, but saw it on an NPDS Newton. In the
   screen shot above, what is the tool bar across the top of the screen.
   This tool looks pretty useful.  Being new, I am still looking for the
   must have list of apps for the Newton.

I have a MP2000 running 717145.

Thanks,
Greg

The images are greenscale if the backlight is on, grey if it's off. Very 
clever.

Avi's Backdrop. Does wonderful things, one of the most popular being 
background images. That would be a must.

So do I.

I've started the redesign of the logging mechanism. If I cannot 
finish it tonight, it will wait until April because I really sink 
under my university work. I'm not sure, but you might need to update 
all the modules. It will fix a lot of crash problem because basically 
I'm removing the last not thread safe part of NDPS, i.e. the big 
unstability I brought years ago when I enabled multiple connections.

BTW, I have enabled robots now. Just to see if it's as stable as it 
should be. I just prevent them to access the screen.

This isn't the latest patch. Apple's latest is 717260, but I fixed an 
additional bug into 710031.

BTW, it's a good idea to install NIE Patch if you run NPDS,

From: Ed Kummel <nospam_tech_ed_at_yahoo_dot_com>
Subject: [NPDS] Re: GifServer question

Question one was answered.
Question two was answered, but you may need some
clarification.
Back when I started newtoning, I had a serious problem
with Heap. Heap is the memory that's available to
applications. Unfortunatly, the more stuff you have on
the Newt, the less you have available to the Heap. I
had an Envoy and the time and the wireless function
took a serious amount of heap. If I added 2 or 3
additional packages, I didn't have enough heap to run
my wireless app. I ended up having a dual-boot Newt! I
dumped all my non-apple-specific packages on a 2mb
card and when I wanted to send something, I would pop
out the card and restart the Newt to get my heap back.
This went on with my MP120, v2.0! Until someone told
me how Heap worked. They said that I can choose a
different app to be the background and that will
release some heap space! I tried all the internal
apps, but none really did much. I found an app called
BackPack which advertised it's self as a background
app. I never understood the usefulness of a background
app until I ran this. It freed up so much heap, it
made my Newton useable again. When I upgraded to my
MP2k, I still used BackPack. It's only been recent
that I started using Avi's because I now run Dashboard
which takes over some of the package launch
capabilities that BackPack offered. 
So, if you've experienced problems downloading email,
or reading huge books on your Newton, consider getting
a background application for your Newt. You'll wonder
what you ever did without it!

  It's a great feature.  I just didn't know about the backlight thing.

  Thanks for the tips.
1. Do I need to install 717260 before 710031?

2. What about that NewtWorks patch on the site?

  Great information, thanks.  Where do you get DashBoard?
I am finding the UNNA does not keep up to date.

 Looks like I have quite a bit of upgrading to do when
I get home.

System patch
NIE patch
background app
DashBoard?

  Fortunately, I have been able to install packages over
ethernet using the PrelimBinaries.  I'm glad since my
Newt did not come with a serial cable or dongle.  I also
need to find all these standard apps people are talking
about like NCU.  I need something to do backups to my
OSX over ethernet/appletalk.

Thanks,
Greg

There is no native backup solution for OS X (yet). The best platform

Hi all,
I'm having trouble running scripts with NPDS. I've got the latest version of
everything, but whenever I run a script, I always get this error:

SSA Error: evt.ex.fr.comp;type.ref.frame

I'm certain that there are no mistakes in the script. Can someone tell me
what the problem might be?

Also, I have several pages being served. At the moment, only the main page,
and the standard 'NPDS Pages' utilise the CSS. How can I add these styles to
other pages?

Thanks,

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS 2.1 being tested

Hi folks,

I'm testing NPDS 2.1 right now.

Basically, I removed every thread unsafety things. Logs aren't 
implemented yet, but the SERV popup now shows the list of the 5 last 
requests (with the client IP). BTW, logs won't reverse-resolve the ip 
addresses any more (I believe this is a source of trouble because NIE 
has a maximum number of endpoints and we'd better reserve them for 
serving). But I'll export them in Apache Combined Log Format.

Also, I wish I knew where NPDS deletes the preferences when the 
version increases too much. I wasn't able to find and I had to 
reenter all my prefs. I'd prefer to avoid this for you.

Let me see how stable this is and I'll release it (with logs). In a 
nutshell, come and visit my server to see if you can crash it ;)

BTW, working on this new version, I noticed that there are two bugs 
in the current server: RFC dates are in fact localized (Camino 
returned me a If-Changed-Since in French!) and one gets a silent 
-36006 when the server is stopped. I'll try to see if I can fix both.

You're sure there is no mistake in the script?
Because this error basically means the script couldn't be compiled.

I think that if the page looks like HTML, NPDS won't add its CSS. So 
you have to add it yourself in your HTML code.

But I don't recall exactly and it's already 1:15, so I'll look 
tomorrow if nobody answered yet.

Hi again,
I'm absolutely certain that there are no mistakes in the script. I've done
direct copy-and-paste from other sites into my script editor. No joy.

When I add the CSS directly to the HTML page in question, do I need to go
<style><!-- exceedingly lengthy style info --!></style>, or can the existing
style sheet be somehow referenced directly?

Thanks again,

  Thanks for help Paul and Ed.  The AviBD seemed to have made the
Newton a little bit faster.  I also found out not to try and install
AviBD or system patches using DCL.  It make the Newton hang.  It seems
that installing system components is not a good idea while there is
an active dock.

David, can you post a copy of the script to the list for us to take a 
peek at? Maybe one of us will spot something. If you copy and pasted the 
script, there may be certain declarations that need to be made as per 
your Newton's environment. Which script was it?

If your style sheet has been defined using the "Edit CSS" button in the 
NPDS preferences, then it can be applied to *all* pages that NPDS serves 
by making sure that the "Insert CSS" checkbox is selected. This is how I 
apply CSS to all of my HTML-formatted notes, as well as plain text notes 
via the whiteboard functions.

You can reference a style sheet hosted on another server using the 
following syntax:

<style type="text/css" media="all">
     @import "http://www.someserver.com/blah.css";
</style>

Or:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/ssi/main.css" 
media="screen">

The @import method will hide the CSS from non-fully standards compliant 
browsers such as Netscape 4.x and IE 3.x. The second method will work 
across all browsers that can parse CSS. This is a good way to provide 
simpler global styles to all browsers (using <link>) while still adding 
more complex and modern CSS (using @import) that newer browsers such as 
Mozilla, Netscape 7.x, Camino and Safari can understand and render 
correctly.

What I have done in my NPDS setup is insert the @import method into all 
of my NPDS pages via the Edit CSS window in prefs. All pages served by 
NPDS then reference the same style sheet that I use on my main web site.

Hi, thanks for the replies.
Firstly, CSS:
At the moment, I have about 4 .html files being served, excluding
index.html. I have 'Insert CSS' checked. However, the CSS is only being
applied to the index, and one of the other pages. The other pages are not
styled. All of the NPDS pages, ie /dates, are being styled.

I haven't tried Grant's suggestions yet for applying a CSS to a page, but
I'll try that shortly.

The two scripts that the Newton is currently borking at:

1.
func(NullVariable)
begin
local theOut;
theOut:= ""NewtonOS Version:"" && Gestalt(0x1000003).ROMversionstring;
return theOut;
end

2.
func(NullVariable)
begin
local theOut;
theOut:= ""AC Power:"" && BatteryStatus(0).ACPower;
return theOut;
end


The only script I have been able to get to work is:
func(NullVariable)
begin
return "bork";
end


Thanks,
David Drew

My guess is that if you put the <html> tag anywhere on the page, the CSS is
ignored... seems that way with my site, anyway.

I think that if the page looks like HTML, NPDS won't add its CSS. So 
you have to add it yourself in your HTML code.

The NPDS Setup package can be found in the 'Server' directory along side 
of the core nHTTPd package:

     http://npds.free.fr/Server/

Make sure you grab all the most recent versions of the packages. nHTTPd 
is at version 2.046 and Setup is at version 2.022.

So, here I am again, back in the fold. Now I can get NDPS to work about three
times, with new modules. Now when I try to restart the server, the loading DHCP
note pops up and stalls. Tapping stop yields a -48807 error. Oddly, other
packages (Newtscape) can use the same DHCP and ethernet card without trouble. NS
can get pages from the net while the NDPS-generated slip persists. Good old NDPS
just sits there spinning. Quitting NDPS still leaves the loading DHCP slip
there. A reset is required to get it back. most annoying. Any idea was to which
of the many modules might be to blame?

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] NPDS 2.1

Hi all,

I've posted latest binaries of NPDS 2.1 on the website 
(http://npds.free.fr). Please test them and tell me how it doesn't 
work at yours.

If you update to NPDS 2.1, you need to update all the components. 
Your preferences might be lost, but I think I fixed that problem.

The changes are:
   Fixed issues with current_http_request global variable and other remainings
   of thread unsafety (basically, I fixed the problem I introduced with
   version 2.03)
   Fixed a silent problem in the server when disconnecting.
   The log now works. Log is in a new format and exported as text in CLF format.
   Fixed HTTP date: it no longer depends on the locale.
   Improved request parsing.
   Probably some other changes I forgot about.

Basically, this new build seems very stable since my Newton didn't 
crash or whatever for 24 hours. The method to export the log 
(:LogToTextFile(nil) I think) gives you the log in CLF format. The 
old log soup is no longer used, the new soup is NPDSLog:MAVON and 
I'll tell you later how this soup is organized and how you can 
produce a nice log analysis. In the meanwhile, you can take the CLF 
and process it with awstats or webanalyzer. The logs are enabled by 
default, if you want to disable them, go to the preferences. The 
maximum # of log entries is the number of entries in the log soup 
NPDS will keep. Each entry currently includes 20 hits (could be more, 
this is processed asynchronously). DNS Reverse Lookup is no longer 
performed.

The new modules are:
BinaryServer 1.2
GIFServer 1.2
CardFile 2.1
DateServer 2.1
nHTTPd 2.1
nHTTPd Setup 2.1
NoteServer 2.1
WebPager 2.1

Let me repeat it again. There is no check whether the plug-ins are 
compatible. You need to upgrade all modules. If something goes wrong, 
you can get back using the previous versions for all modules.

OK. This isn't NPDS 3.x yet, but I removed the biggest problem I've 
introduced into NPDS 2.x with multiple connections.

  I have 2 questions.

1. When will the Binary Server 1.2 be available?

2. How do you upgrade.  I just realized I haven't upgraded a package
   before on a Newton.  Do I just install the new version over the old
   or do I have uninstall the old first?

Thanks,
Greg

Paul must have been editing the index.html file with a Unicode text 
editor. Every character in the file had an invisible extra byte 
associated with it. Since I added an iso-8859-1 character set meta tag 
earlier today, your browsers were expecting to parse an ISO-encoded 
document, not one using Unicode.

I have fixed the home page, and left the Unicode one for reference - just 
in case any one wants to look at it further. It's something I've never 
seen happen before. Here's the screwy version:

     http://npds.free.fr/weird.html

Say Paul, how did you edit the document in the first place? The .txt 
files you updated were not affected.

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] NPDS NPDS Site Updated & Reorganized
Date: Fri, 14 Mar 2003 22:10:47 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

When it rains, it pours.

As previously mentioned on this list, I went ahead and reorganized quite 
a few things on the NPDS site. Most notably, I have renamed and 
standardized all of the directory names so they no longer use spaces and 
have added a separate index page listing all of the various NPDS modules. 
I also added links on the home page to all of the NPDS documentation that 
we currently have available on the site.

You can read about all the changes in the change log:

     http://npds.free.fr/changelog.txt

Many of the changes I made are to get the site ready for full conversion 
to XHTML and for the start of formatting (and making pretty) using CSS. 
Please note that if you previously linked to specific 
module directories from your own sites, these paths will have changed. 
Here is the link to the new NPDS Modules page:

     http://npds.free.fr/modules/

Hopefully everyone will still be able to find everything they need. I 
believe that these changes make for a more easily accessible and 
organized site.

Your feedback is always welcome.

You have to delete the packages first. The installer won't let you 
override a package.

Sorry folks. I used BBEdit and I didn't even check the result. Grant, 
I think you can trash the unicode version.

I edited the .txt files on the mac and then uploaded them while I

Sorry for the trouble.

Grant, are you testing the new web pages with Newt's Cape?  If the XHTML 
breaks compatability with Newton browsers, then that would suck...

No worries. It was just a bit of a shock when I loaded the page. It was 
easily corrected. Since I had been working on the site earlier in the 
day, I thought it may have been something that I did. :)

I've tested both XHTML Transitional and XHTML Strict with Newt's Cape, 
and they work. That's the beauty of clean, simplified structured data - 
it just works. The only thing that Newt's Cape can't parse is the initial 
<?xml> declaration which appears outside of the <html></html> tags. It 
shows up at the top of the page in Newt's Cape, right under the page 
title. I would imagine that Steve Weyer could clean this up with one of 
two lines of code if needed.

If you want to test an XHTML Strict version of the NPDS home page for 
yourself, try this:

     http://npds.free.fr/test.html

Does this issue only affect the preferences, Paul? Does it impact the hit

There were two bugs.
The first bug is that you can lose the preferences after an update. 
The second bug is that the main preferences were never updated (so 
you would never lose the hit counts among other things).

I think I fixed both bugs. The first bug is weird. Took me some time 
last night.
The bug occurs if the commented lines below are uncommented:

These lines shouldn't be uncommented to let you go back from 2.1 to 2.0x.

I wonder if this is related to what is explained here:
http://www.mactech.com/articles/develop/issue_26/newtonqa.html

or if it's a bug in NewtonScript's world.

I didn't try to isolate that problem yet.

BTW #1: the second bug disabled the watcher here (before I fixed it). 
I re-enabled it, but in the end, it restarts my Newton without any 
reason. So I wish you disable the watcher for a while so I'll know if 
2.1 is that stable. (the watcher is still useful if one has a -10061 
or a CGI that crashes the NewtonScript task).
BTW #2: exporting the log to a text file takes a long time. And a new 
entry in the log soup is created everytime you restart the server.

I didn't lose any preferences or the hit count. Naturally, I backed up 
everything six way from Sunday - just in case.

Do any of these changes impact the way the Wipe utility works? Just

Thank you, thank you, thank you. The new log format and handling is a

I've just realized that Wipe probably won't wipe Binary and GIF

Maybe you can enable BugTrap to catch any exception and send the

The next step is to get a nice way to extract this from the Newton 
and generate nice reports with charts and so on.

What do you use for your own sites? Urchin? Webalizer?

If you can install BugTrap and send me the bug report, I might be able to help.

However, I think this is the update prefs bug. Please either:
install 2.1, try it and if you don't like it install 2.0x (2.1 will 
have cleaned the preferences)
or
try Wipe and lose your settings.

You bet. I always have BugTrap enabled, actually. Any specific BugTrap 
settings you'd like me to use? I current have "Crashing inside a Try" set 
to "Ignore".

Keep it like this. I don't think there is any silent (i.e. caught) 
exception around, but there could be and this wouldn't be a problem.

Heh. This means more work than just extracting the logs and then 
processing them on a desktop computer.

BTW, beware of the size. I just checked, my NPDS log soup includes 37 
entries for 147 KB. It fully logs the user-agent (in UCS-2), this 
increases the size of the log a lot.

I promised the format, so here is it (in case anyone wants to start 
this log analysis tool for the Newton).

I haven't figured out how to know the size of a Newton object except 
with very slow TrueSize statistics method, so I limit to 20 log lines 
per soup entries to not create too big soup entries. For the moment a 
new entry is created everytime the server is started so don't rely on 
the number of entries in the items array (it could even be zero).

Each entry in the log soup (NPDSLog:MAVON) has the following structure:

created: the time in seconds since 1970 when this entry was created 
(use this to sort the entries across soups)
class: 'access (ignore any entry with another class)
items: an array which elements are frames:
{
	host: the host IP as a NewtonScript string
	time: the time the page was sent, in seconds since 1970. (integer)
	bytes: the number of bytes sent, excepting the headers (just 
like Apache's log information) (integer)
	result: the result code (integer)
	request: the full request line (e.g. "GET /html/cockpit HTTP/1.1")
	referer: the referer header's value or NIL if no referer was provided
	agent: idem with agent
	user: the authenticated user used to access this page or NIL 
if the page was accessed anonymously (currently always nil).
}

There is an index on created and another one on class.

LogToTextFile creates an array with all the entries that are of class 
'access. This is probably why it is so slow. A better approach is to 
query on the created index (theSoup:Query({indexPath: 'created})) and 
then filter entries that aren't of class 'access. I wasn't very fresh 
when I adapted the old LogToTextFile method.

I also wonder if I should add to the log soup the X-Forwarded-For header.

Hey Josh.

Good to hear from you.

It is very stable. Paul and I were just exchanging WebPager messages, 
comparing uptimes. His server is coming up on 66 hours. Mine is just over 
30 hours. No crashes. No BugTrap exceptions. No NPDS Watcher. Lovely.

>I'm also glad to see that the /html/admin-post.html page is still there

Oh good, someone else noted this issue with admin-post as well. I thought 
it might strictly have something to do with posting to a folder whose 
name consists of more than one word. This is partially true,  but there's 
more to it. You can post to whatever folder you like if it has a single 
word name. However, admin-post will also create an -empty- note in 
whatever folder happens to be currently selected in the Notepad. Posting 
to a folder that has two or more words in the name results in the posted 
note *and* the -empty- note both ending up in the Unfiled notes folder.

If you don't mind me doing a bit of light editing and formatting, I'll 
take a copy of your draft and post it to the NPDS development site as 
part of the growing (if not random) documentation section. You'll be 
credited as the author, naturally. It this cool with you?

My latest issues seem connected to Watcher.  I'm turning it off.  It 
would be cool to see this type of fault-tolerance in version 3, though. 
  IP Failover anyone, with all the NPDS nodes out there?

Awesome!!  I was so flattered when I went to the NPDS page to get the 
newest components and saw the documentation about the Notepad Server 
Configuration; I was so surprised to see my name at the top!!  It had 
been so long since I had used NPDS, but I was thrilled to see that my 
documentation from so long ago was still relevant and available.  I 
cannot wait to help with the documentation for version 3.

Grant:  let me update a bit of the documentation and add a bit more 
tomorrow, and then feel free to take it from there.

This is unfortunate. There might be a bug here but without a bug trap 
log, I cannot guess where it is. Any chance you would install BugTrap?

I've used this form for the first time ever this morning.
Grant seems to have found the clue.

Great. Some pages aren't accessible yet, but it would certainly 
complete the NPDS Network Setup help page.

I got 3 -36006 on Disconnect. But I'm making them silent (in my NTK 
inspector I found one of these errors that come from newtVNC - I 
wonder what is happening there).

Definitely. If you look at the source code, the label is there 
without quotes. I'll test a new build with quotes in a minute.

OK, I didn't have this one. You can reproduce it every time you post 
a note? Josh, you have the same issue or this is Grant-specific? 
(hey, would be a nice bracketed name).

OK, this space in label bug has been fixed. I also fixed the bug Paul 
Filmer reported eons ago, the status icon being reverted to idle 
whenever you minimize/maximize NPDS (actually this bug appeared when 
we introduced minimization).

Finally, I've decided to truncate the output of LogToTextFile to 
around 32 KB because it chokes my Newton otherwise (even if I save to 
a VBO, I suspect that it chokes when it tries to save it to the Notes 
soup). My log soup is around 227 KB and when exported to works (did I 
mention one can export the log to NewtWorks now?), it is around 150 
KB. Let me test it a little bit and I'll post the new build.

The only BugTrap report I've had in the past 43 hours or so has been this 
connection-related error:

http://207.34.68.38:8080/html/-72365934$1166.nsd

I can reproduce this every time. It may actually have something to do 
with BugTrap. BugTrap creates its reports in the Unfiled folder. However, 
if I have any other folder selected in Notepad, BugTrap will also create 
an -empty- note in that particular folder, along with putting the report 
in the Unfiled folder.

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] nHTTPd 2.101

Hi all,

I've uploaded 2.101 on the website.
The changes include:

- Fixed robots.txt.
- Something else I already forgot.
- :LogToTextFile(aStore) is now limited to 32 KB
- added :LogToWorks(aStore) which isn't limited (although it can be 
slow if the log is big).
- Fixed the folder popup that occurs with admin-post.html.
- Made -36006's on disconnect completely silent.

Let's give complete release notes (as far as possible).
Among the things I forgot to mention in the Read Me.txt, I've 
improved the general 404, 400 and 500 error pages. I also fixed the 
bug Paul Filmer reported eons ago about the icon.

The -36006 syndrom is the following:
You get a 'A communications problem has occurred. Connection may have 
been dropped.' message with, optionally, a bug trap log looking like 
Grant's:
http://207.34.68.38:8080/html/-72365934$1166.nsd

This kind of errors occur with other Newton internet applications, so 
I don't know what to think about them except that now I catch them 
and you will no longer get the dialog and the bug trap report (unless 
you tell BugTrap to trap exceptions inside try/catch blocks).

I didn't fix Grant's problem with double notes creation, but actually 
this bug remains unconfirmed as BugTrap does the same. I suspect a 
problem in some Notes extension he might have rather than a problem 
with NPDS or BugTrap.

:LogToTextFile used to take a parameter that wasn't used. You should 
better continue to provide nil. If you want to provide something 
different, provide a store. Nil means to use default store. This 
method indeed now returns a VBO (because it can be around 32 KB). 
BTW, this method is misnamed, it just generate a text log. Umm, I've 
just realized I have broken the /cfg/ logs viewer. You'll see the new 
500 page then.

:LogToWorks creates a newtWorks document. If you don't have 
newtWorks, it will display an error message. The code is made in such 
a way that it should run on NewtonOS 2.0 (i.e. display the error 
message). The parameter is the store to create this document to. It 
defaults to the default store if you provide nil. Please note that 
this method doesn't erase the log, it's not a log rotation method.

Robots.txt. Robots are now allowed to come and visit our Newtons. I 
just forbid them to go to /screen/ because this means heavy 
transfers. Maybe I should add /bin/. What do you think?

What else?
Oh, I forgot to add X-Forwarded-For in the log soup. Next time, no biggies.
And the supported version of NPDS is now 2.1 WITHOUT the watcher. The 
watcher breaks down 2.1 (and probably made the previous versions a 
little bit unstable).

I might work on it one of these days. Please note that if the watcher 
is disabled and you restart, the server will be restarted and the 
watcher will be enabled. So you'd better freeze it.

OK, if I summarize what is left for 2.x:
- fix /cfg/ logs view
- add X-Forwarded-For in the log soup
- fix the watcher
- Esthetic changes to the pager

What did I forget?

I'll play around with this some more. I'll freeze a few superfluous 
extensions I have loaded on the server and try to narrow down why it's 
happening.

I don't mind robots scraping my site for images, but if the binaries are 
larger zipped packages and such, it could be a problem. Can we make the 
robots.txt easily editable? That way we could specify something like:

Disallow: /bin/zip/*

I noticed you added a warning on the modules page about this. I'll add a 
bit about freezing the package next to the Watcher section.

Thanks, Paul. I know this one is for me.  :)

Okay. I'll try to figure out how two notes can be added instead of one.

Well, this isn't really needed here because large binaries cannot be 
served. The binary server sends the binary in a single chunk and NIE 
doesn't like it if the chunk is too big.

So serving large binaries and specifying the robots.txt will be 3.0 features.

I've decided that I shall sort features between 2.x features and 3.x 
features. Especially since 2.x is stable now.

>By the way, you accidentally Unicoded the modules page. I fixed it.

Er. You're right. BBEdit played a trick on me again, although this 
time I explicitely edited an index.html file that I set to ISO-8859-1 
and then uploaded it with ncftp. I don't know how, but this file 
happened to have been encoded in UTF-16.

That's makes sense. I don't think leaving /bin/ open to robots is any 
major cause for concern. I'd leave it alone for now. By the way, I have 
some other questions regarding binaries and BinInstaller, but I'll start 
a separate thread on that.

I'm sure that I'll start running into this sort of thing the more I use 
OS X. Right now, I can't seem to get out of my OS 9 comfort zone. Aaahh...

Subject: [NPDS] How do you use BinInstaller?
Date: Tue, 18 Mar 2003 13:19:34 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

I have been playing with BinInstaller this week and have started 
migrating a few images over to my Newton to be served using NPDS. I have 
also started writing a 'user manual' of sorts, documenting the creation 
and installation of various types of binary packages using BinInstaller. 
This manual will become part of the rapidly expanding documentation on 
the NPDS site. (Yea!)

I'd like to solicit feedback and tips on how you have used BinInstaller 
for your own sites. I have come up with a couple methods of doing certain 
tasks, but they are by no means the bible on binary package creation. I 
want to compile and distill down as many different techniques and 
gotcha's for this user manual.

Here are some questions to ponder:

* How do you convert binary files into NTK resources?
* What types of binary files have you created?
* Is there a binary file size limitation?
* Is there a binary package size limitation?
* Is there a maximum number of binary packages that can be installed?
* Have you experienced any repeatable errors, bugs, or crashes?
* Have you used BinInstaller under Windows? If so, how?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.

I'll be posting a preliminary version of the BinInstaller documentation 
later this week.

Cool.  I also made a VB app for Windows called BinInstaller, it uses Sloup on
the Newton side and a serial cable to upload binaries into the soup.  It
works, I think.

> Here are some questions to ponder:
> 
> * How do you convert binary files into NTK resources?

NTK has built-in functions to do this I believe.  At least NTK/Mac does.  But
it doesn't have to be an NTK resource - that's only if you want to embed
resources into your package that can be easily accessed by NewtonScript
(standard PICT images, sounds).  We're not concerned with that, just raw
binary data.

> * What types of binary files have you created?

I've uploaded lots of stuff while testing BinInstaller.  I think I was testing
with small (less than 128K) RTF and DOC files.

> * Is there a binary file size limitation?

According to Paul, the maximum that NIE can send in one buffer, whatever that is.

> * Is there a binary package size limitation?

Probably half the available flash on your Newton, as the package has to be
uploaded into a temporary VBO, then its InstallScript writes the data to the
BinServer soup, and then the VBO gets deleted - so at most there will be two
copies of the data somewhere in the Newton's storage space.

> * Is there a maximum number of binary packages that can be installed?

Same limit as a NewtonScript soup.  I'm not sure that that has a limit... if
there is, its probably 2^30 (the upper bound of a NewtonScript integer).

> * Have you used BinInstaller under Windows? If so, how?

I wrote it :)  I think the largest binary I wrote to my Newton was around 32K
before the Sloup connection mysteriously stalled.  I don't remember if I
tracked down this bug.  I might have.  I vaguely remember fiddling with serial
port options in VB until it worked.  I know that Notes2Notes has no problem
moving large chunks of data like this, so it's my code somewhere.

Maybe we should post the VB version of BinInstaller to the site too, say 
what? You don't have a link to it on chuma.org do you? I'll have to add 
links to Sloup as well.

I'll have to look closer at this. I've been opening binary files with 
BBEdit and then copy/pasting the raw data into a resource template within 
ResEdit. I'm assuming that you can just point NTK at a binary dump of a 
file and change the way the makefile references it.

Oh yeah, I forgot about word-processing documents. I suppose you could do

He mentioned the buffer issue. I'll have to get the details from him.

Oof. That's probably plenty of headroom. It's a good point for the 
BinInstaller FAQ, tho.

Any additional information that you can recall would be marvelous. 
Hopefully, I'll be able to get the VB app running under Virtual PC and 
then I can illuminate the throngs with multi-platform screen dumps galore.

Nope. This is the hard part of making binaries. BBEdit is a good one, 
indeed. Actually, I used MPW's sample code DerezPict (takes a Pict in 
data fork and puts it into resource fork). Should be doable with OS X 
since I think they took MPW's Rez and DeRez to make OS X's Rez and 
DeRez.

>He mentioned the buffer issue. I'll have to get the details from him.

The limit is low.
If you guys ask really nicely, I could fix that and increase it by 
sending data in chunks.

2^29, I'd say. I've never seen negative _uniqueID slots.

Yep.  Well, of course that's for MacOS Classic where you have forked files.

Yup.  My BinInstaller automatically sets the MIME type based on the file
extention.  The Binary Server then returns this MIME type to the client, so
everything is hunky-dory.

Hope VirtualPC can emulate a serial port for you...

I really wish that Sloup could listen to a TCP/IP port.  Steve Weyer seems to
want nothing with the Newton anymore, which is find, but it already supports
ADSP, so how much harder could a TCP/IP server be?

Insane idea for investigation later: writing an NPDS module that reads data
from a GET or POST and processes it in Sloup.

Put it into a table that is centered in the body.  Like this:

<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<td>Graffiti header stuff</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

By default, the text will be aligned in the middle of the TD, and it should
look nicer with the images.  For the opposite of what you have now, you would
use <td valign="top">.  For exactly what you have now, valign="bottom".

You're sure that browsers are supposed to render it like this?

The problem is that I would like Graffiti to be centered on the line 
and visitor to not be centered. In a nutshell, I would like to take

Screeeech!

Sorry, but I must attempt to put a stop to superfluous table usage. Paul, 
when I look at your page code, the img tags do not have any sort of align 
attribute. There are, however, ampersands in there:

<img src="/html/274493539$935$0$33.ink" alt="inkWord" & width="80" 
height="35">

Just add an align="middle" attribute and value pair to the images and 
they should align better.

<img src="/html/274493539$935$0$33.ink" alt="inkWord" align="middle" 
width="80" height="35"> 

Do know that you're scaling the ink images as well? They'll render 
cleaner if you don't scale them.

Yes, I allowed it to go through before I saw Victor's second post.

It's just for you. Your messages will go faster to the list if you 
post with your right address because I won't have to accept them ;)

Still doesn't solve the various baseline, but sounds a good approach. 
I did that. The Visitor ink word now looks ugly. Maybe I should 
decide whether to include the align word depending on the baseline. 
Do you have any better suggestion?

At first, I wanted to recognize the ink to put it into the alt tag, 
but it would take too much time ;)

BTW, this can make a server unresponsive for a while because of the 
limited number of endpoints one can have at the same time. Imagine a 
page full of ink.

I do it on purpose. If I increase the size of the ink (with the 
Styles palette), it will appear bigger on the web page. Currently, my 
Newton displays the ink at 75%.

It's easier for me to ask the desktop browser to do the actual 
rescaling than doing it myself ;)

If you can tell whether any of the characters hang below the baseline in 
the ink text, then you could contextual set the align value. If the text 
has no descenders (visitors) then set the align value to "baseline" or 
"bottom". If the text does have descenders (graffiti) then set it to 
"middle".

This particular issue makes my previous suggestion less suitable.

Got it. Maybe you need to write smaller.  :)

From: Josh Burker <nospam_senorwences_at_mac_dot_com>

Can somebody confirm for me that logging works in 2.101?  I cannot get 
it to work:  I get an Internal Server Error.  The /cfg page loads fine, 
but when it goes to produce the log it fails.

I have removed the NPDS log from Storage thinking it might be corrupt 
again, and I've restarted, toggled Logging on and off and back on.

Thanks,

I would vote for this method. Since we know the limitations of the Newton 
software and have a fairly good idea that unless something drastic 
happens, very little development will occur on these browser down the 
road to accommodate the modern formats and protocols.

That being said, is there any merit or efficiency in sending slimmed-down 
data to browser that aren't compliant or compatible with CSS, JavaScript, 
etc.?

>Do you know any other browser we could avoid sending this

Well, there's a nice list and archive of pretty much every browser 
imaginable over at evolt.org. I suppose we could build a list of 
possibilities.

   A question I had a while back comes to mind: why isn't there a way 
for a server to query a browser not for what it is, but for what it can 
do?  Instead of a server delivering different content based on whether 
it is IE, Netscape, Lynx, whatever, have it be able to specifically 
tell whether the client browser supported CSS, JavaScript, Java, etc.  
This would solve the problems of new browsers like Chimera (well, 
Camino now), with which you either have some pages that don't work, or 
have the browser identify itself as IE, in which case some things may 
not work either.  Of course, I'd figure Microsoft would hate this kind 
of a spec, because it means they'd have to follow the DOM specs and 
such to the letter (although I've read that IE is among the more 
standards-compliant browsers out there - at least the Mac version ;-)

Hi,

I have now compleatly reinstalled my Newt and still NPDS will not work.

I backed up my pages to a card, erased everything, and installed 
everything back again.

When I serve the first page I get disconnected and the following message:

And most times (not always) I get:

The first message looks like French to me, but it doesn´t tell me 
anything. Guess Paul Guyot knows better than me what this means.  :-)

When I switched to my Farallon card I got:

This time I got 2 logs from BugTrap:
The first log mentions a get for "/favicon.ico" so I changed browser from 
Safari to OmniWeb. 
With OmniWeb I can browse my Newt without problems. But as soon a browser 
that asks for favicon.ico my webserver dies.

Hi,
I'm getting this exact same problem. The error message seems to vary. My
NPDS server seems to be stable. However, I can _always_ get this message
when I try and access the server logs.

In unrelated news, I discovered the reason why the CSS wasn't being applied
to some pages served. It turns out that when <title> tags aren't encased
between <head> tags, the CSS isn't applied to that page.

Thanks,
David Drew.

David, if you have the latest version of nHTTPd installed (2.101), please 
note that the log file display functionality is currently broken. Paul 
mentioned this in the 2.101 announce message.

The log file issue shouldn't have anything to do with the type of errors 
that Halvor is experiencing. Something else is going kerflunky there.

Hi,
I'm aware that the logging is currently broken. However, I was expecting to
see the new 500 error page, not these TCP proto errors in Freedom.

In one page, the <title> tags were within the <body>. In two pages, they
were before the <body>, but I had given the page no <head>. I know, my html
is extremely poor. I don't even use </p> tags.

Thanks again,

Well, sort of. Logging _is_ working in 2.101, but log viewing is 
temporarily busted. Paul mentioned this in the announcement message:

In the meantime, you can export the log file to either Notepad or

Actually, it could kill the server in 2.1 if the log was too big.

LogToTextFile doesn't export to the notepad but exports to text.

You have two options (to put in a DashBord or NPDS script)

GetRoot().paperroll:MakeTextNote(GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|:LogToTextFile(nil), 
true);

GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|:LogToWorks(nil);

Of course. Grant promised to cook us a nWebalizer.

>P.S.  My NPDS has been running for over 15 hours now!!  Incredible, Paul!

Both my Newton and Grant's became unavailable. Mine rebooted and 
since I froze the watcher, NPDS wasn't restarted. I don't know about 
Grant's.

Hey, Paul. Could this be what happened to my server? I wasn't running 
2.101 with the changes to the log creation code. Just a thought.

I think it could restart the server or make it unavailable for a 
while. I don't think this is the cause of your downtime since you 
gave me hints about what occurred.

Heck, not that hard.  Just write a single NewtonScript function that reads the
log soup, does its stats mojo, and writes HTML to a note in the proper folder.

You see, Josh, not only did Grant promise us a nWebalizer, but 
moreover Victor will help. I think you'll get the first beta of

Gah, I've got to do real work today, and you guys have me thinking about

Well, I think the best is to make it a separate module that will 
provide log rotation, export to notes/works, put digested results 
into its own soup, serve the content of this soup when you access say 
/stats/ with nice pie-charts and compress the old log entries with 
ZLib, etc. Ok, I admit this will be 0.2 ;)

Let's prioritize that list:

1. digest logs into summary pages
   - by day/week/month/overall
   - HTML pages written to folder in Notes
1.5 export to Works as an option (?)
2. save summary entries into its own soup
   - optionally delete log entries that have been processed to save space
3. make into an NPDS module, serve up data at /stats/
4. draw pie charts with Paul's PChart module ;)
(actually, the only Newton app I've see draw pie charts was the PieChart
memory-usage app: http://roger.trideja.com/newton/piechart.html )

Seriously, writing a module (that can serve web pages) is as easy as 
exporting to notes (which means you have to (a) name smartly the 
notes, (b) link notes together, (c) file the notes to the NPDS 
folder, (d) implement user authentication into NPDS core and its 
usage into the NoteServ module).

So I'd say:
1/ write a dummy module that serves a page not found error 
(eventually, this should become a nHTTPd function)
2/ design the GUI with an Export raw log to Works button that just 
calls :LogToWorks.
3/ design the soup format. In fact, I think several soups might be better.
4/ write a function that takes the log soup and digest it into 
monthly stats in a special soup. It can optionally purge the log 
items from the log soup.
5/ finish the server so it serves items from this soup, making it HTML.
6/ add a scheduler using NewtonOS' wonderful periodical APIs
7/ serve pie charts as well as simple vertical charts (awstats just 
defines <img> tags with a width and a height and serve a dummy 
picture. You could avoid this with CSS I guess.
8/ compress the old log with ZLib.

Subject: [NPDS] Browsers

Hi all,

I was wondering: what do you think the policy regarding browsers should be?

When NPDS appeared, there weren't that many browsers doing CSS and 
Javascript around, so Matt decided to test user-agent strings against 
a set of browsers.

I think that now most browsers do CSS and JavaScript (actually, if 
they don't, they can ignore it) except the three Newton browsers 
(especially NetHopper which doesn't like charsets different from 
mac-roman).

What do you think we should do? Should we always send CSS, JavaScript 
and charset information except for Newton browsers? Do you know any 
other browser we could avoid sending this information? (say lynx & 
links?)

Or we could just use MARC, like NTLK does.  If you have old messages in mbox
format they should be able to do a bulk load of the old stuff as well.

I've asked MARC in the past and they didn't reply.
I also have the source code of HyperMail somewhere on my disk.

I have some C++ code to convert Eudora mBoxes to Unix format, btw. 
Gotta finish this for Friday next week.

I have an AppleScript that does the same thing, plus another that 
converts Claris Emailer (my client of choice) to standard digest format. 
I'm customizing one so that it spits out HTML. I have Hypermail loaded on 
the Newted server, but haven't mucked about with it yet. It doesn't 
really matter what we use, I'd just like something complete and 
consistent.

Let me work on this one. You guys have enough stuff on your plates as it 
is.

Subject: [NPDS] tracker client question
From: "Gregory Gee" <nospam_newton_at_gee.homeip_dot_net>


  I was wondering if someone could explain how to use the tracker
client.  The docs don't seem to match what I am looking at.

Tracker 2.035
nhttp 2.042

  My mainquestion is setup behind a firewall.  I see how to set the
public IP, but can I set the public port?  Or do I have to run
NPDS on the same port that my NAT will pass?

  In the tracker server section, what's the difference between
the 'Newton Port' and the 'HTTP Port'?

Thanks,
Greg

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] BinaryServer 1.11

Hi all,

I've just uploaded Binary Server 1.11 and BinInstaller 1.1.

What's new:
* Binaries are now served asynchronously and in chunks (it means you 
can serve large binaries).
* Fixed the about box bug (Grant, Wed, 19 Mar 2003 19:26:02 -0700)
* The installer template now copies the binary into a compressed VBO
	(allows binaries larger than 64 KB)

You can update the module without restarting NPDS. Binary Server 1.11 
requires nHTTPd 2.1 or higher.

You'll find this on NPDS website (http://npds.free.fr/modules/binaryserver/)

This time I saw the BBEdit 7.0.3 bug in action. Sending a bug report.

Special thanks to Grant for testing this new version (including 
serving QuickTime sample movies ;)

I think Matt did this to save CPU.
The only mandatory requirement is to send no charset indication to NetHopper.

Considering the limit of 16 endpoints in NIE (geez, I hate this low 
limit), I think I'll work toward limiting the data sent. OTOH, I 
probably could patch NIE to increase this limit a little bit, say 
with 3 or 4 left shifts.

Are you sure?

Did you check:
http://npds.free.fr/docs/new/NPDSNetworkSetup.html
And:

You have to run NPDS on the same port that your NAT will pass. It is 
explicitely mentioned in the first documentation and maybe in Josh's 
document. Is it a problem for your network?

>   In the tracker server section, what's the difference between
>the 'Newton Port' and the 'HTTP Port'?

Matt's tracker served the HTML document on port 80 via a CGI and 
talked to Newtons on port 2110.
Victor's tracker serves the HTML document directly. Set both port 
numbers to 3180.

Il me semble que le 22/3/03 à 22:32 -0500, Gregory Gee nous racontait:

That you have older settings: the tracker client tries to connect to 
Matt's tracker (on port 2110) and the server doesn't respond. The 
tracker client is basd on Apple's Thumb sample code and it sometimes 
displays these weird messages intented to demonstrate the use and 
features of FSM with NIE.

Update the server to misato.chuma.org or npds-tracker.continuity.cx.

First, a server doesn't query a browser. The browser sends 
information about what it can do and what it wants, and the server 
replies. This information can include preferences and therefore there 
can be what one calls content negotiation.

But in this negotiation scheme there is no CSS/JavaScript and Java 
information. It is either languages the user wants (I'll probably 
include negotiation on the server with NPDS 3) and MIME types (like 
if the browser can do text/xml, can read GIFs, etc.). NPDS doesn't 
take this into account yet.

To know if a browser can do CSS/JavaScript and so on, one usually 
parses the UserAgent string. So a new browser like Camino is likely 
to include "Mozilla/5.0" in its User-Agent string. This is a de-facto 
standard.

FYI, Camino prefers text/xml to text/html & text/plain and pngs & 
jpegs to gifs.

But you're right. I think I'll follow Grant's wise suggestion. NPDS 
will send full content except for Newton browsers and I'll omit the 
charset indication for NetHopper.

I was able to visit your Newton and get one or two pages.

Could you please tell us which Newton you have? What is the value of

What? Didn´t you get the whole mail I sent to the list?

So that was you then!  * Evil grin * 

I needed the power supply for my other newton, so it never came back on 
again. I´ll hook it back on now.

MP2100, not an upgraded 2000. Running your latest patch to the latest OS

MaxClients settings? Me stupid, you explain, o´wise one.
No I did not run wipe. When I got these problems the first time I backed 
up my HTML pages and _totaly_ erased everything on my Newt.
Then I upgraded it to 710031, installed NPDS and still got the problem.
No need for wipe if I totaly cleaned it I thought...

> NPDS? Do you have installed and enabled the watcher?

Hmmm..   For some reason I thought it wasn´t compatible with the latest 
version, so I haven´t installed it. (Where did I read that?)

My bad. It's Eudora beta's poor handling of UTF-8.
So I only see the bugtrap log now.

I have the tracker as my home page, so I quickly see it when a new 
server is online ;)

Right here or on the website. Indeed, please don't install it.

After analyzing your bugtrap logs, I'm quite lost. Maybe checking the 
maxClients settings wasn't a bad idea after all. Please open the 
preferences ([i] Prefs) and then choose the Admin tab.

What happens is that somewhat some endpoints are lost and NPDS uses 
NIL. Is there any chance that you could hook NTK or run ViewFrame 
from your Newton?

Hmmm... Havn´t run NTK since MacOS 9, running X now. I´ll see.
What is / how does ViewFrame help us?

Doesn´t everybody else have the same problem?

Have everybody else installed a favicon.ico icon in the binary server or 
something like that, which make our intalls different?
I have installed the binary server and a binary installer, but haven´t

That should be port 3680.

Also Paul, I noticed a bug in the tracker server the other day: you can 
register with an empty hostname.  I'll fix it and send you the new source today.

ViewFrame is a development tool that lets one run NewtonScript code 
on a Newton and inspect NewtonScript structures.

>Doesn´t everybody else have the same problem?

No. David said he has the same problems but I'm waiting for his 
bugtrap report to confirm. Until then, I consider it's a problem on 
your Newton only.

I've tried to get favicon.ico on my Newton's and it didn't crash it. 
Everyone here except you who runs NPDS 2.1 gets very long uptimes, 
totally unrelated to what NPDS 2.0x since I hacked it used us to. 
There is a bug in 2.1 and 2.101 which limits this uptime around three 
days statistically, Grant and I are running pre-release builds to see 
if indeed, I fixed the problem.

>Have everybody else installed a favicon.ico icon in the binary server or
>something like that, which make our intalls different?

It sounds a good idea, and actually I thought about installing a 
default icon into NPDS.
However, you cannot customize /favicon.ico. You can only customize 
/bin/favicon.ico, which requires to set it to be so in your web pages 
with something like:
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/bin/favicon.ico">

And it means that if one accesses /screen, they won't get your 
favicon. I'm not sure how to add '<link rel="shortcut icon" 
href="/bin/favicon.ico">' into every page including Notes pages.

I put that into the newly created NPDS 3.x ToDo list.

We may as well give the Binary Server a real test right? Here are the

really should move my stuff to a bigger card and then I could serve stuff 
like the MP2100 user manual PDF...)

You guys have been reading my mind. I was just finishing up writing the 
section of the BinInstaller user guide on how to create and serve 
favicon.ico files out of the binary soup.

>And it means that if one accesses /screen, they won't get your

If it were up to me, I would handle it similar to the way NPDS 2.x allows 
you to optionally insert CSS into every served page. Make it a checkbox, 
with wither a field to specify the name of the file or a pop-up. Perhaps 
NPDS could look at the contents of the binary soup and if anything is 
defined as having a 'image/x-icon' MIME type, then it would appear in a 
pop-up list within the prefs window.

>I put that into the newly created NPDS 3.x ToDo list.

That must be some ToDo list by now...

Paul, I discovered that this same bug exists in the current versions of 
CardServ, DateServ, and NoteServ (2.1) as well. All of the other modules 
seem to be unaffected. It's not a big issue, but I though you might like 
to know about it. I can supply additional BugTraps if you like.

Paul, I don't know if this is specifically Binary Server related, but 
BugTrap generated the following report. It looks like it crashed during a 
Binary Server disconnect, but I could be reading the report incorrectly. 
I have not had this particular crash before:

http://207.34.68.38:8080/html/-72365934$1292.nsd

Oh, and the about box of the Binary Server says the version is '1.101' 
rather than the '1.11' currently mentioned on the NPDS site. I'm not sure 
which is the accurate version number.

Thanks.  The tracker module page refered to the 2.0 docs at

even though there were a few dead links.

 Not a problem, it just wasn't mentioned on the pages I was looking

  Great.  I noticed on the NPDS homepage that it says to use
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:8080 if I am behind a firewall.
Does this particular one require the Newton and HTTP port to be
set to 8080, just like Victor's are both set to 3680?

Thanks,
Greg

Sorry for the confusion Gregory. The original NPDS documentation is 
severely needing an overhaul. In the meantime, I have just added links to 
the NPDS Network Setup document from the HTTP Server and Tracker Client 
sections of the Modules listing. Hopefully, this will be clearer for 
folks in the future - at least until we get around to rewriting all of 
the full NPDS documentation.

I believe that this is mentioned because many firewalls do not pass 
traffic on certain ports (such as 3680). Most firewalls however, will 
allow traffic on port 8080, since it is generally accepted as an 
alternate port for the HTTP protocol.

  Now that I have my NPDS up and running, I really need to change the

Do people really use the Notepad to edit there pages?  I recently grabbed
nHTML.  This will help quite a bit.  But I am looking to tips on editing
pages off the Newton.  Please note I only have an ethernet connection.
My newt doesn't have any serial cables(need to get one).  Also, I am

I fixed it in NoteServ. I'm making a note to do it for CardServe and DateServ.

It didn't really crash but just threw an exception. You didn't get 
any message, did you?

My bad. If you recompile the source code, it will say 1.11 (which is 
higher, I follow Matt's decimal notation).

I make a note to re-upload the files.

I need your help to set it up.
Please check:
http://newton.kallisys.net:8080/html/274493539$1122.nsd

And please post about anything I forgot.

BTW, I might have solved the Communication was dropped message error, 
but my server stopped working for a while just like Grant's did. I 
know what is happening but I don't know why. I was able to smoothly 
resurrecting it by closing an endpoint and telling it to listen 
again. I'll dig further on this problem.

I've also updated the tracker on amaterasu 
(npds-tracker.continuity.cx). FYI, the box is currently submitted to 
emergency procedures because it is being attacked from a Windows box 
with HTTP requests, so it is a little bit the panic here.

This is mostly to see the tracker server from a web browser. If your 
Newton cannot access a remote host on port 3680 and you cannot change 
anything in that regard, it's not very likely that the world can 
access it and therefore tracking it is meaningless.

In a previous message, Paul Guyot typed vigorously:

Actually, I did. But I cannot remember what it was. I tried emailing a 
Screen Shooter dump of the message, but then SimpleMail burped.

Are you closing the endpoint via NewtonScript or through the Inspector?

I forgot many features I guess.

I know what I will start with: the native server and the module/core interface.
Or I should say what I did start with since I started these parts already.

About templates: I think the best approach is to make templates 
something that provides various stylesheets, default index.html 
files, error pages, modules template pages (whiteboard, cardserver, 
dateserver), favicon.ico  icons and some artwork associated with 
them. Except the default template, templates will be in packages one 
could load and choose from.
And we would have the possibility to customize every bit of the 
template elements with Notes, Works and Binary Soup entries.

So template support will be built in into the Core while various 
modules could provide replacement files that would override them. In 
fact, templates will be NPDS modules themselves.

My diagnostic snippet didn't reveal anything:
>foreach endpoint in GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|.fServer.mEndpoints do
>begin
>	write(endpoint.eState && endpoint:state() & "\n");
>end

This is because the system is looping stupidly between endpoints.
However, this snipped showed that the listening endpoint was the first one.
So I killed it with:
>GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|.fServer.mEndpoints[0]:TearDown()

(at that point, every endpoint was in bound state). (0 means the 
first one, replace with the index of yours, between 0 and 15).
And I told the server to pick one for listening with:
>GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|.fServer:NewListen()

After I saw his BugTrap I tried to get /cfg/ wich gives me the exact same 
error.
Actually I found out that it crashes everytime if the first "directory" is 
anything else than /html, /screen or /bin
So these will crash the server and give status "404":
/cfg
/favicon.ico
/anything
/asdf/something.more

These will generate a nice error to the user but not give status "404" but 
"SRV":
/html/anything.html   (not a valid page)
/html/something		(not a valid page)
/html/<some_number>.nwt (Dont remember the extention .nwt?)

Since I have some Norwegian settings, I have disabled them, but to no joy.

First yesterday I found the great PrelimBinaries. It only works for US and 
German Newtons.  What versions of Newton is there and could this be the 
source of my problems here?

I have also found out that if the driver for 3c589D is active, BugTrap 
will not work! FYI

It is nsd, I think (Victor who currently sleeps more than I do will 
correct me).

So we're narrowing down the problem.
You say you get a crash when you try to get /cfg, so I guess that the 
remote admin isn't enabled. Could you please check?

I don't know how this could influence NPDS.

Er...?
It doesn't work at yours?
You don't have a US/Intl MP2100?

I wonder what your problems with the DCL PrelimBinaries are. David is 
using a MP2100 US.

Again, this is weird. I have never heard of any problem of this kind 
with BugTrap.

I looked on the various ethernet cards people use. (btw, Grant, the 
link to NPDS on your "Welcome to my Newton" page is broken).

But finally, thanks to your and David's help, I found & fixed the 
bug. No one else has this problem because we all enter a PublicIP in 
the tracker client.

(I forgot to mention: SERVER_NAME is now properly replaced with what 
it should be)

Script Editor:
>24/03/2003	2.1 [Paul Guyot]
>	Updated for NPDS 2.1

I could have installed unstability into nHTTPd 2.102 compared to 
previous releases, so beware (nevertheless, Grant and I were running 
2.1011 or more recent builds without any problem for a while and it 
included the first fix). I do an early release because of Halvor's 
and David's issues.

The Script Editor was simply broken with nHTTPd 2.1 upgrade.
Other updates are mostly esthetic.

I have just realized I should have posted the new Tracker Server as 
well but I should also work on other things.

Correct! Not enabled.

Hmmm..   What was I thinking? Yes, it works.

That was what I was wondering. Thought I had an ordinary MP2100. Bought in 
Sweden though...

I can have both a 3com and a Farallon installed. If I use the Farallon 
BugTrap works. If I use 3Com BugTrap doesn't work.
Both times 3Com extentions is installed, but only used when I use 3Com 
card of corse.

I thought is was .nsf (Newton Streams Format)?  .nwt are those attachments
that the OutBox attaches to outgoing e-mails.

(I'm sleeping more than Paul?  Is that because I was sick and resting over the
weekend, or because I'm an ocean away from a certain country and hey, gas is 7
cents cheaper per L today...)

I always have this driver active and I've never had this happen with BugTrap.
 My NPDS server is running a 3c589D right now.

I checked, it is .nsd as in:
http://newton.kallisys.net:8080/html/274493539$1122.nsd

I don't know what it exactly stands for, it's probably in NPDS 2.0's 
manual. I used .ink for forthcoming NoteServ release as in 
http://newton.kallisys.net:8080/html/274493539$1117$0$1.ink

>(I'm sleeping more than Paul?  Is that because I was sick and resting over the

I said so mostly because you're around to correct the stupidities I 
write here (such as the tracker port) and indeed I thought you sleep 
more than I do with your current sicknesses. Plus you told me you 
didn't waste your time watching news on TV :)

>I always have this driver active and I've never had this happen with BugTrap.

Okay, so Halvor is having issues somewhere else, as I thought.

>  My NPDS server is running a 3c589D right now.

Good to know. I've updated my own page mentioning which ethernet card 
I use. Also, with nHTTPd 2.102, one can check the pages with W3C's 
services.

Nope. It's not in the manual. I would guess that Matt could fill us in. 
My best guess is that it stands for "Newton Server Data" or "NoteServ 
Data". If we do find a definitive answer to this, I'll add it to the 
Newton Glossary and the NPDS docs.

Paul, I've added mention of these updates to the changelog.txt file.

I'm thinking that I may turn the changelog into a multi-user weblog type 
of thing. It would appear on the home page specifically for posting short 
news blips and updates such as these announcements. First of all, I need 
to finesse a style sheet into the site so it doesn't look quite so 1995.

Thoughts?

>(I forgot to mention: SERVER_NAME is now properly
>replaced with what it should be)

I also added this specific nHTTPd change to the associated read me file.

The unreleased 2.1011 version of nHTTPd seems to be just as stable for me 
as the previous version. I think the the majority of the issues I was 
experiencing were due to the binary server and other silliness I was 
doing on my Newt.

>I have just realized I should have posted the new Tracker Server as

No worries. Take as much time as you need to get the rest of your work in 
order. I think we have enough to play with for now. :)

The thing is that there is a copy of the Read Me file inside the disk image.

I feel that it's currently not very convenient to update the modules. 
I'll start with designing a droplet that creates the .img.bin 
directly (for the moment I have a script that does the .img, I need 
to drop it on NutCase MacBinary to encode it). Also, these images 
require MacOS 8.1 or higher. Fellow developers using Basilisk II 
might not appreciate, I'll update my script to make 7.5-compatible 
disk images.

I think I got a -36006 recently, but the state of endpoints was 
correct. At least we won't lose any precious endpoints now.

It would be fairly easy to implement using Blogger, since it would be

Oh dear, I forgot about the disk images...

Ideally, I'd like to get all of the older .sit files migrated to the same 
encoded disk image format. If you haven't noticed, I enjoy consistency. 
:)  If you can finalize how you want to build the disk images, let me 
know and I will go through the older archives and convert them.

Free has PHP + mySQL. But no perl indeed.

OK. I write down a note to create a script to automagically convert 
.sit to HFS-formatted .img.bin, the format I'd like to use (for the 
moment, I use HFS+ formatted .img.bin).

I'll use it on my own website.

Josh,

There are two dead links in your documentation:

http://12.242.161.93:8080/html/linksys
http://12.242.161.93:8080/html/conclusion

I guess these pages aren't available on purpose, aren't they?

BTW, trackers share their records.
Your Newton also appears on:

Apparently you have a MP2000 with very few heap. This can explain 
crashes. Try to set the maximum number of clients to 4 (this is in 
the preferences, admin tan I think -- you need to stop and start the 
server for this change to be taken into account). Maybe freezing one 
or two packages will help as well.

The Newton becomes completely unresponsive?

It really sounds like a memory problem.

The default setting is to not serve /cfg/. Which lets one stop the server.

However, one can post admin notes with the default password if you 
don't specify one yourself at /html/admin-post.html. The main risk 
here is that one posts a new index.html that would take over yours.

Yes, that's the unfortunate part. I use Blogger on my sites because I can 
set up a separate account on the FTP server that accesses only the 
specific weblog directory. I can see where this wouldn't be possible on 
Free.

>Free has PHP + mySQL. But no perl indeed.

I didn't realize that we had PHP and MySQL available on Free. There are 
several PHP-based weblog or news systems out there. Two interesting 
possibilities are PHPosxom and Thistle, which are PHP-based tools that 
use flat text files to store content, rather than some convoluted MySQL 
setup. I'll look into these as a possible (simple) solution.

Oh, I forgot this one.

There are three bugs:
- the server sometimes makes a 'A communication problem occurred' 
error appear. I thought I fixed that with nHTTPd 2.102, but 
apparently not. I've surely improved the error handling, tho, there 
was an obvious flaw there.
- when this happens, if you have nHTTPd < 2.102, one of the endpoint 
(the client as in MaxClients, I took the Apache terminology) dies.
- the server sometimes enter an endless loop of setting up an 
endpoint to listen, failing, doing it again and so on. I thought I 
improved this with nHTTPd 2.102, but apparently not. Apparently, 
nHTTPd 2.102 change will make the server a little bit less responsive 
but maybe a little bit more stable.

All these issues occur because with the NewtonScript layer for 
endpoints, you cannot have one endpoint that listens and client 
endpoints that will do the actual work. The listening endpoint has to 
be the one that processes the request and when it started processing 
it, I can fire another endpoint to listen. With recent NPDS builds, 
there is a pool of endpoints that are prepared so firing them to 
listen takes as less time as possible.

NPDS 3.x will have a native server based on some test code I've 
written. It means that there will be a listening endpoint and 
different client endpoints responsible for the connection. Please 
note that nevertheless, we might lose connections. There is no 
tilisten module or equivalent on NewtonOS endpoints implementation, 
AFAIK.

Please get 2.102 and setup BugTrap to catch exception inside Try

I should have elaborated on this one. In a nutshell, anyone using 2.1 
should upgrade.

With details: the server will crash badly when the log soup gets 
full, i.e. when there are more entries than what you chose in the 
preferences, generating -48803s. My own setting is 150 and I 
currently have 135 entries for 487 KB of log, but default is 30.

This is purely esthetic.

Correct behavior is to display this footer:

NPDS/2.101 (NewtonOS) at 24.157.128.34 Port 8080 (you would have 
recognized Victor's IP ;)

But 2.102 does:

Hello,

I am trying to get NPDS working on my 2000U. Everything installed fine and I was able to get to the home page no problem. I am having trouble with the notes server. My notes are showing up in the list but when I click on one I get a page cannot be found. Both folders in the config are set to Posts. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This would be doable. However, my archives are archives of digests. 
So the result won't look like NTLK's Hypermail's output.

However, I'm pretty sure we can gather all the mails that went in 
individually. I still have most of them.

Er. Well, we could do that by subscribing some fake account to the 
list and get it making hypermail archives.

I asked marc folks to archive the list but they never replied/acknowledge.

My default page and the style sheet are customized versions of the ones I 
have on my main site. Generally I use BBEdit to code all of my pages on  
my Mac. For complex pages to be served with NPDS, I usually build them on 
my Mac, then copy and paste the code into a Whiteboard or Admin Post 
form, sending it directly to my Newton into whatever folder I want. Once 
it's on the Newton, I can fiddle with it in Notepad.

I pretty hand code everything from scratch, but I do use nHTML for a lot 
of repetitive things.

I was going back through my archived messages and found a couple of

thought it might be interesting to review these threads in respect to the 
NPDS 3.x to do list. We've covered a lot of areas in these two threads, 
and a few interesting points may have been forgotten over the past

Subject: [NPDS] NPDS: documentation question

Hello all,

First off, let me just say that I feel like Rip Van Winkle over here! I have
been away for a short while and low and behold, there is quite a flurry of
activity here now! Cool!

So multiple binary images on NPDS works much better now huh? Great! I'll
have to dig back in!

MY QUESTION:
I have been reading the NPDS Documentation (that Grant has done a great job
with), and was reading the "NoteServ Configuration" page. How does NPDS know
what notes are created by www visitors and which are created locally on the
Newton?

There is a slot added to notes posted from the NPDS server. This slot 
basically includes the author of the post, I think.

If NPDS can find this slot, the note will be listed under <POST*> 
SSIs (not sure of the SSIs, tho). If it cannot, it will be listed 
under <NOTES*> SSIs.

I know it lacks a user interface. The best interface would be a 
transport you'd access from the envelope for posted notes (so you 
could remove the post information).

If the NPDS Admin page is still broken in 2.103, ignore the following:

Attempting to view a server log creates a bug report that contains the admin

Yeah, that's something that this documentation doesn't really go into; 
it's never been explained to me how NPDS distinguishes, but it 
definitely does.  I would be happy to update the documentation on my 
NPDS server and Grant can grab it again and update the npds.free.fr 
site if Matt or Paul could explain exactly what is being tagged onto 
the Note that lets NPDS know which notes are posted by vistors and 
those created locally or via the admin-post.html page.

Just let me know when it's ready to grab. Same goes for your 'NPDS

I haven't switched all of the images found on my NPDS server pages over 
to use the binary soup yet. I'm swapped them out one at a time. Sometimes 
it just makes more sense to host the larger images off my main server 
instead. Speed considerations and all.

FYI: Josh Burker wrote the Notepad Server documentation, not me. I'm just

Indeed. This script refers to the global variable that was suppressed 
since global variables are not thread safe by definition. This 
contained a description of the current access and since nHTTPd can 
handle several connections at once, it didn't really make sense (and 
explained empty log entries and so on).

I don't know how you could provide such a reliable script with the 
current architecture.

The closest is an array of the 5 last requests that you can access if 
log is enabled (this is what is shown when you tap the diamond).
It's at GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|.lastRequests

It can be NIL if no request is present. Don't rely on the number of 
items either. And please note that this array is filled *after* the 
page is processed.

Every script that refer to the internals of NPDS can be broken by any 
change in NPDS. There is no "public interface" of NPDS, one usually 
takes any slot to write a script. I try to maintain every f-prefixed 
method, though.

Subject: [NPDS] Use of NPDS behind a firewall
From: Donald Wilson <nospam_marchie_at_mac_dot_com>

I'm using OS X, 10.2.4

Here's my setup:

router -> G4 en0 -> G4 en1 -> Newton

I can forward port traffic from the router to my G4, which I do for the 
webserver on it, amoung other things.

I figured I'd run the NPDS webserver on port 8088

I ASSUME I need to set up some kind of forwarding table on the G4 to 
send the requests thru to the Newt, but I'm not sure how. Any help?

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Watcher 1.1a1

Hi all,

Apparently, I got the watcher working with nHTTPd 2.1x

29/03/2003	1.1a1 [Paul Guyot]
- Reorganized the code, it seems to be compatible with latest nHTTPd.
- The three checking routines can be enabled and disabled separately now.
- The check for alerts routine now explicitly looks for protoTCPServer alerts.
- Fixed a problem where the server might not be restarted if the 
internet setting is to disconnect immediatly.
- Improved the way the alert is handled (the watcher will be 
triggered even if it's not the frontmost view and it will close it 
once the server will be restarted).

It's on the website (http://npds.free.fr/modules/npdswatcher/)

I'm going to build a new version of nHTTPd from a discussion I had 
with Nicolas yesterday at Lunch time. Basically, I suspect NIE to not 
like the way I'm recycling endpoints, so I'll kill them and recreate 
them instead. Might improve stability.

If you are a heavy NPDS user (i.e. your Newton is connected 24/7) and 
you prefer to test this new build instead of testing the watcher, 
drop me a line. I might freeze the watcher here to see if NPDS is 
more stable with this change, but since I'll work on ATA Support, 
I'll probably reboot this development unit very often.

Paul

Depends on how many NATs you have. I think that OS X doesn't give you 
much options and you should have two NATs, one on your router and one 
on your G4. So you need to tell the router to map 8088 to the G4 and 
the G4 to map 8088 to the Newton.

Right now, my mac is connected to my Newton via the serial port, so I 
cannot easily plug it somewhere to have the Ethernet enabled and try 
Internet sharing to see if you have the proper options there. Anyone 
else knows this feature of OS X?

Ok that makes sense. I'll just need to look up how the NAT file works...

Do you run NPDS over a serial connection, Paul?

I'm trying to get my 130 to work over a null-modem connection, and 
having trouble.

No, I have an Airport base station connected to the cable modem and 
my Newton as well as my laptop uses it as the router.

I use the serial connection to connect NTK and Hammer to my Newton. 
NTK also does AppleTalk but because of the pathetic Airport range I 
have with my Powerbook, AppleTalk goes on and off without any warning 
on OS X and it is a big pain, so I prefer the serial line which can 
also be established faster.

Apparently, there might be some problem with the newest watcher (but 
it restarts NPDS like a charm), I would like to catch this. But I 
think that in fact, it's just the very idea of the watcher that is 
wrong.

If checkListening is enabled, the watcher will try to listen on port 
8080 (or whatever NPDS listens to) and note that it succeeded if it 
did. The problem is that it can succeed from time to time when NPDS 
fire an endpoint to listen. In that case there is a bad conflict. I 
don't know any way which would let me know if the Newton is listening 
on port 8080 except by trying to listen and see if the system 
refuses. But now, you can disable this check routine and still 
benefit from the two other check routines of the watcher (the 
protoTCPServer alert and the NS Task that died). And even if you 
enable this feature, the watcher restarts the server like a charm (at 
least with my tests). I suggest setting the check period to 30 
minutes to avoid too frequent tests.

My Newton is online 24/7, so I'd be happy to try the other version of 
nHTTPd. I'm probably getting between 75 and 125 hits per day.

>PS: Happy birthday Grant, late, but next year my Newton will tell me ;)

Thanks Paul. We had a houseful of family last night, and a bunch of 
friends are coming over this evening. It's a non-stop party here in 
Calgary. Even the pink plastic flamingos that some anonymous soul planted 
in our front yard think so.

So what version of nHTTPd does Watcher 1.1a1 work with?

P.S. Is there already another meens to reboot the Newton and/or nHTTPd if it

I would imagine that it is meant to be used with the most recent release 
- which is currently 2.103

Only manually. Hit the reset button or use a GestureLaunch script or 
Dashboard to trigger the reboot. You can also simply stop and restart 
NPDS in most cases.

It works with nHTTPd 2.1 and higher, apparently.

The big difference is that you can enable and disable various parts 
of the watcher. I'm not very happy of this release and of nHTTPd 
2.104.

Subject: [NPDS] 2.1 reflections & Logging
From: Josh Burker <nospam_senorwences_at_mac_dot_com>

I had not run NPDS for quite a while, so after seeing Paul's 
announcement that 2.1 was available with fixes for Grant's logging 
issues, I downloaded all the newest versions of the components, 
installed them, and started serving again.  Paul should be proud of his 
accomplishments; compared to 2.045, which I had been running, 2.1 seems 
very stable.

I did note today that after some type of crash that took down the 
server I was unable to access the log at all; while the /html/cfg page 
loaded, I would get an Internal Server Failure error when NPDS went to 
display the log.  I ended up trashing the NPDS log in Storage and 
starting the server again; now I can access the log.  I found this to 
be interesting, but without BugTrap installed I can't offer anything of 
use to Paul.

I'm also glad to see that the /html/admin-post.html page is still there 
in version 2.1; I wish that the ability to select which folder in Notes 
the admin wants to post the note actually worked:  it posts to the WWW 
folder no matter which folder is specified.  A work around would be to 
post a note the normal way and link to the admin-posted notes by their 
titles (/html/unix for example).  Since NPDS supports links in the 
notes this isn't difficult but it is inelegant.  I really hope version 
3 might contain an admin-post option, as it is very nice to consider 
the possibility of posting to any folder on a remote Newton.

Additionally. I have resurrected a draft of using NPDS with firewalls; 
it is available on my NPDS server.  While some of the information is 
available in the NPDS documentation, some expands upon it a bit.  The 
links are outdated, some lead nowhere, but if people are interested in 
me improving it I could find the time.

Again, thanks for such a great project Paul and all the others who work 
so hard on the NPDS suite.  I look forward to the innovations that 
version 3 might bring!

Cheers,

Josh

I have a DashBoard script that does that, Paul gave it to me a while back.  It 
dumps the log to Notes.  I'll try to get it to you tomorrow.

Umm. There is a problem indeed. It's been eons since I checked my 
logs and although logging is enabled on my Newton, I only have one 
entry in the log soup (for the tracker), even if I do access my 
Newton.

The weird thing is that I cannot find the code that actually logs 
regular requests, even in older versions.

(later)

OK, logging is completely broken in 2.046. Apparently, I removed the 
line that actually logs by mistake, but if you add it back (in 
protoTCPEndpoint:DoUnbind), it will be buggy as it used to be in the 
past. I haven't understood yet how the Newton logged a tracker 
request yesterday night. Maybe it's time to redesign this log feature 
and make it thread safe.

>It'd sure be nice to be able to write the log to notepad or works,
>wouldn't it?

That can be done very easily with a script.
I had two scripts:
- one from DashBoard that Victor talked about
- one from the Script Editor so you can let people access the stats 
without using the config module (http://foo/cfg/).

Basically these scripts uses the text export of the log feature of NPDS.
You access this text with:
local theText := GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|:LogToTextFile(nil);

(parameter is a remnant of some feature (?) and is unused).

You can create a new note with it with:
GetRoot().paperroll:MakeTextNote(theText, true);

You can also iterate in the soup directly to create a nice table with 
all the entries and so on. The format is quite simple. The soup's 
name is "Log:MAVON". Each entry is a host.
The IP is in ip slot.
The domain name, if present, is in name slot.
You have a requests array in the entry. Each item is a frame. Path 
slot is the path, Time slot is the time in Time() format (minutes 
since 1904).

I have a theory. I had an error request (error requests are logged 
under some circumstances). Then I had a tracker request. It filled 
the global variable about the request and then the error request was 
logged. So in the end, the logged request was that tracker request.

Sounds plausible. And definitely means that there is a need for a big 
refactoring of this part of NPDS.

This is a bad news considering that:
- 2.104 isn't that stable, so I'll probably revert to 2.103's way to do things.
- the disk image on my own machine is empty as well.
- backups occur on the 23rd and 2.103 was released on the 24th (like 2.102).

Fortunately, I know what I changed between 2.103 and 2.104 and 
between 2.102 and 2.103. 2.102's disk image is correct.

Great. I try to catch such an error from a post I sent to Tim. Could

- install Bug Trap

- access the page

I'm now using NPDS 2.103 and have had it running as long as 5 days without a
hiccup. I then tried the newest tracker, which is supposed to get along with
2.103, and immediately was having reboots every couple of hours. Got rid of
the tracker and I'm now chugging along fine (so far) again.

I was wondering how everybody else is using HTML to display Newtscript code
on a web page.

My attempt doesn't seem to be the best way.


You can see the result of my attempt here...

And you can see the HTML I used for my attempt here...

Let me clarify.

Everything has been working fine. It just looks kinda ugly (very long and
spaced out).

Yes the note is filed in a folder that NoteServ defines as accessible, and
it can be accessed.

Yes I have tried that too, and both the unique ID method and the Note Name
method work.

You don't have to apply <XMP> to every line, do you?  That's probably why your 
browser is spacing the lines out so much.

In fact, to quote the Netscape HTML tag reference here:
http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/htmlguid/tags4.htm#1424741

"The XMP tag displays a sequence of literal characters in the browser's 
default fixed-width font. The XMP element displays all white space and line 
breaks exactly as they appear inside the <XMP> and </XMP> tags."

So you definately don't have to stop and start the XMP tag with every line of 
code.  XML suppresses interpretation of all HTML tags and entities except for 
its end tag, while it's kissin' cousin, PRE, allows for interpretation of HTML 
within a PRE tag.

Thus endeth the HTML lesson :)

However, the <XMP> tag was deprecated as of the HTML 4.0 spec back in 
1997 and quite frankly should not be used.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/changes.html#h-A.3

There is no guarantee that future iterations of browsers will support 
this tag. Officially, they don't have to support deprecated or obsolete 
tags. I would suggest the use of the <PRE> tag in conjunction with 
converting all '<' and '>' characters to their equivilent HTML entities: 
&lt; and &gt; - this is what I do in my NPDS served notes.

>Thus endeth the HTML lesson :)

And thus endeth the additional forward compatibility and web standards

Well thanks guys!

I knew that the <XMP> tag had been "retired" and it's use was not
recommended. But I couldn't find/didn't know of another way to achieve what
I was trying to do.

I thought that I might find my answer here, and I was right!


Thanks a bunch guys!

Subject: [NPDS] Error when deleting log soup
Date: Thu, 3 Apr 2003 20:52:33 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

The other day - for whatever reason - I decided to delete the NPDS log 
soup while NPDS was still running. I thought I could simply purge the 
storage to start fresh and NPDS would create a new soup when the next hit 
was recording by the server. What actually happens is a BugTrap report 
for each subsequent hit. Here are three reports generated in series:

http://newton.splorp.com:8080/html/-72365934$1301.nsd
http://newton.splorp.com:8080/html/-72365934$1302.nsd
http://newton.splorp.com:8080/html/-72365934$1303.nsd

Stopping and starting NPDS does not solve this problem. I had to reboot 
the Newton in order for NPDS to recreate the log soup and for the BugTrap 
reports to stop. This isn't a huge issue, seeing as the log viewing 
function is broken at the moment anyway, but I thought I would mention it.

I believe this occured in both nHTTPd versions 2.103 and 2.104.

I thought that this might have something to do with the fact that the 
note was created without a title. I used to get similar errors on my 
server. However, I just tested it on my Newt and couldn't reproduce the 
error no matter what combination of folders and/or data I tried.

On a related note, I'd like to thank Paul for fixing the problem with 
posting to a folder that has a multiple word name. I hadn't tried out 
this particular fix yet. It makes my life just a little bit easier.

Yes, sometimes it dies.

Two weeks ago, I had a deep look at the way 2.103 works.
Apparently, there is a reentrance problem there. In some hard to 
reproduce circumstances, NPDS asks bad things to NIE. I've even 
started to design a flowchart of the server (I know that Real 
Programmers don't draw flowcharts. Cavemen drew flowcharts, and look 
how much good it did them.)

I will try to fix it before leaving for Mexico as my goal is to have 
my Newton serving web pages for 3 weeks in a row. Of course, this 
supposes that no one unplugs the cable modem.

The issue is that this simulation software that should be ready 
before my trip is more urgent than NPDS stability.

PS: I will probably hit the 80K record in the next days. 79940 as I 
write this (1 day and 3 hours of NPDS uptime, 5 days and 10 hours of 
NewtonOS uptime).

This would be an nice feature.
Other options include automatical detection of the IP address from 
the tracker. This should be the correct IP in 98% of the situations. 
We should still provide an optional Public IP field so users could 
use a name or enter an IP in case the IP isn't the one the tracker 
sees.

I'm half-ashamed to have thought this way: the problem with 
automatically detecting the IP is that setting up NPDS might seem too 
easy. The most difficult part is configuring the router for port 
mapping and we currently have no control over this. Rejecting 
registrations with a bad IP forces networking newbies to look into 
the documentation or ask here.

Consequently, if we do something automatic, I'd like that it goes 
something like:
- the Newton asks to register on the tracker server
- the tracker server keeps the connection opened and then tries to 
access the Newton's server port
- the tracker says 400 if it failed to access the Newton's server 
port (timeout or connection denied).

We probably can implement this without changing the client. I think 
that its timeout is long enough.

I left my NPDS serving while I went to New Zealand for a week, and when 
I came back it wasn't serving, but it hadn't crashed or anything.  As 
people have noted, sometimes it just goes deaf.

Since then I have loaded the newest Watcher onto my Newton.  It was 
rebooting quite frequently until I asked it just to make sure NPDS 
responds; I'm not having it check the NewtonScript or anything.

It's restarted the server a few times since then, but it's pretty 
flawless (knock on wood).  The server has been available each time I've 
checked in on it.

I've setup a bug/feature requests database.

http://bugs.kallisys.com/

You can login as guest (password is guest).
You can also ask me for an account (please provide a password you 
would remember), so you will be able to Watch bugs (get e-mail 
reports) and have a selection of your own bugs/feature requests.

Choose the NPDS queue to add bugs & feature requests for NPDS.

Your comments are highly appreciated. It took us (with Nicolas) some 
time to find a decent bug/feature request tracking software that 
could be used for various projects (BugZilla is nice but actually can 
only be used in Mozilla-like projects with plenty of applications, 
each one divided into modules and hundreds of thousands of bugs).

A nice feature of RT is that it can have customized keywords. 
Keywords basically play the role of the popups/selection boxes in 
BugZilla (like version, module, whatever). Please use them to file 
bugs & requests and send me suggestions for more keywords if I forgot 
any.

RT isn't really pretty but it's functional. I love the e-mail reply 
feature (basically, you can reply to a message you got as a requestor 
(provide your e-mail address) or as a watcher, and your reply is 
added to the bug database and can be viewed in the web interface).

I'm thinking that there were ampersand (that is: '&') characters in both 
the title and the text that you pasted into the Admin Post form. The form 
isn't encoding the '&'s as entities prior to posting and NPDS uses '&'s 
to string the various form value pairs together in the URL sent to the 
server. The text breaks at the '&' because NPDS parses the form data and 
skips to the next value pair at the ampersand. I verified this behavior 
on my own NPDS server. It's one for the bug fix list.

Try posting after changing the '&'s to 'and's.

That makes sense to me; I did have ampersands in the message where it

And yes, I had the internal address posted.  My error.

This is the wrong setting.

a/ are you sure you have the latest version of the tracker client?
b/ you need your public IP. The Newton cannot guess it on its own 
since it's in a LAN.

>register with tracker:  checked
>tell about 4xx errors:  unchecked

Uncheck it and you'll see that the tracker server basically tells you 
that you try to register with a wrong or a private IP.

You need to figure out what your public IP is. For that purpose, you 
need to eitehr go to Airport Admin and then go into advanced 
settings, Internet (for Airport 3.0) or just Internet tab and read 
your IP there. Or you can use services such as 
http://checkip.dyndns.org except that those give bad results if you 
have some proxies set.

Paul, I had a brainstorm: why don't we have the tracker server output the
outbound IP address of the connection as part of the 400 error?  That way
people can at least figure out what their external IP is at that moment in time...

Running 2.103 and the newest Watcher, it seems that you can run NPDS

I'm running 2.104, which is a bit different internally than 2.103. NPDS 
generally runs non-stop for somewhere between 18 and 36 hours. Watcher 
restarts the NPDS process in most cases, occasionally rebooting the 
Newton altogether. About once per week I need to manually reset the 
Newton because the whole thing has locked up. All in all, it's the most 
consistently performing set up I've ever had.

It's not perfect and I know where exactly there are problems.
I'm running 2.103 for the moment and it seems quite stable indeed. 
Let's see if my Newton will keep running for 3 weeks.

BTW, my VNC scriplets work like a charm, I was able to start VNC, fix 
the timezone and close VNC.

I'll post the source code when I'll be back at the end of the month. 
It's not very complex.

I use newtVNC.

I just launch the server from a special NPDS page that includes the 
SSI and then I connect to my Newton with VNCThing. Afterwards, I go 
to the NPDS page that closes newtVNC.

I configured the Airport base station to forward the port properly.

Yes! It does Grant!

Paul, I would really love to have this function on my Newtons. Is there any
chance you could share the code you used for your SSI.(My guess is that it
was really simple for you to create, but would take me several months of
studing NewtScript before I could even attempt it.)

Paul shared these scripts with me. You can called them using an NPDS SSI 
tag set up through the script editor.

// close script

func(nullVariable)
begin
// script template
GetRoot().|vnc:tknollsys|:close();
"VNC Closed"
end


// start script

func(nullVariable)
// script template
local vncApp := GetRoot().|vnc:tknollsys|;
vncApp:open();
AddDelayedCall(func()
GetRoot().|vnc:tknollsys|.authenticator.connectButton:buttonClickScript(), 
nil, 1000);
"VNC Started"
end

Booyah!

It will be great in NPDS 3 when this is part of the feature set,  
according to the "Towards NPDS 3" discussion:

Thanks for the scripts!

You have to setup VNC as a server before using these SSIs. They do 
not change VNC settings and if VNC is setup as a client, you'll 
launch the client. Please make sure your router or whatever forwards 
requests on the VNC port to your Newton.

Also, apparently, when you run this, some errors might occur. The 
first thing I do in the VNC sessions (did two from Mexico so far) is 
to acknowledge the error notification and close the notepad 
(apparently I have bugtrap enabled, I could disable it).

Plus it's really slow (even when I tested the thing in Paris on my 
local network).

But it works.

I'm sorry I did not have more time to work on this and on improving 
the stability of NPDS before leaving.

From: "Gregory Gee" <nospam_newton_at_gee.homeip_dot_net>


  I have a feature request.  Is it possible for the 'hit' counter
and logger to exclude the tracker server hits.  It would be interesting
to know how many hits I really get instead of the 48 extra hits/day
from the tracker servers.  From what logs I can see, most other hits
look like hackers.  If not excluding tracker hits, can we control
it some how?

Thanks,
Greg.

You can export the log for the moment in Combined format.
You can get it by calling :LogToWorks(nil) method.

I think a scriptlet like:

GetRoot().|nHTTPd:ALLPEN|:LogToWorks(nil);

will do it.

You can run this from ViewFrame for example. The log will then be 
saved into NewtWorks. Then you can import that to a desktop log 
processing software.

>From what logs I can see, most other hits
>look like hackers.

You're on port 8080? Some stupid script kiddies think that your 
Newton could be an open proxy. I usually get a lot of requests asking 
for google page or other well known websites.

>If not excluding tracker hits, can we control
>it some how?

You cannot control it yet. Hits are handled in the HTTP servers and 
every request is counted as a hit.

The best would be a page hit counter that you could put here or 
there. You can do this easily with an SSI.
Let me improvise this.

func(ignoredParam)
begin
	// This SSI symbol.
	local kSSISymbol := '|HitCounter:Kallisys|;

	// This page.
	local kPageSymbol := '|home|;

	// Get the prefs from the system soup.
	local thePrefs := GetAppPrefs(kSSISymbol, {});

	// Extract the current count for the page.
	local theHitsData := thePrefs.(kPageSymbol);
	if (theHitsData = nil) then
		theHitsData := { count: 0, resetDate: Time() };

	// Increment for this hit.
	theHitsData.count := theHitsData.count + 1;

	// Save the prefs.
	EntryChangeXmit(thePrefs, kSSISymbol);

	// Display the information.
	return theHitsData.count && "hits since" && 
DateNTime(theHitsData.resetDate);
end;

OK. This is totally untested, my Newton stayed at the Hotel and I 
don't even have NPDS installed on this one. You can duplicate it for 
several pages, just change home with whatever you want.

In NPDS 3, SSIs might have parameters.

Yep.  It started taking web hits this morning :)

The Tracker server will stay there, but I'm seriously considering moving my
other sites off of that machine, since I am now limited to 45GB of transfer
per month.  Although as long as I can still download Six Feet Under and South
Park every month without going over, I should be alright :)

45GB! Jeeze. My limit is only 11GB/Month - with $10/GB overage charges. 
And I think I'm paying more per month than you too. Ah, tis the bane of

Subject: [NPDS] Problems with BinInstaller

Hi,

I just started to play around with the BinInstaller.
By the way, where is the documentation?  ;-)

I installed a GIF called ming.gif - worked nice.
I installed a GIF called mp2100.gif - The installer crash when I transfer 
the pachage. Screen dump here:
http://www.kise.com/newton/BinInstaller/screen.gif

I try to load both GIFs (together with npds-share.gif) at my online Newton 
at http://158.36.48.10/html/about.html

This is what I did:
Opened NTK.
Opened ResEdit and made a new resource in the "GIF section". Opened the 
new resource in the intarnal "Hex Editor"
I put mp2100.gif into HexEdit (program). I copied all the HEX-code and 
tried to paste it into ResEdits Hex Editor. Seems like ResEdit cant handle 
so much info, so I had to copy/paste the code in to parts. Seems like both 
addresses and code match.
Save ResEdit
Added the GIF to the installscript in BinInstaller.
Save NTK
Build NTK (Command-1)
Transfer the new (and bigger) BinInstaller package to the Newton and *CRASH*

All my files is provided in this ZIP archive if somebody would be so kind 
to have a look at it and tell me what I have done wrong.

If you intall and activate BugTrap and tell it to catch exceptions 
within try blocks, we'll have more details. This alert just says that 
an exception occurred during installation.

The Zip does not really help because all the MacOS resources were lost.

I ran into this problem as well. What I ended up doing as a solution was

That was done, but BugTrap 1.6 wasn't catching anything. Or at least 
nothing appears in the Notes. Yes I remembered the try blocks.

Bummer!
Will the BinInstaller.sit at the same location work better?

Just in case - Lets just pretend that there _could_ be - someone with very 
little experience with ResEdit, NTK etc.
Will they find this little trick in your documentation?

In case - Still pretending here...  ;-)  If I where such a person... and I 
couyld not wait for the documentation to be finished.

How did you do that? (Just blew my cover, didn't I?)

You really need to set it to catch exceptions and then it will create a note.

>Will the BinInstaller.sit at the same location work better?

Yes.
The package you created will add the tree pictures in the soup. So I 
suggest that you delete the binary soup and try to install this 
pacakge.

Also, please note that your GIF is 20 KB. You're below the actual 
limit, so it should be ok. Ensure that you have enough free space on 
the default store for both the installer and the GIFs.

Finally, I suggest using Binary Installer 1.1 instead of 1.0. It lets 
you save bigger binaries and it saves them compressed.

HTH,

Paul

You can find the reports at:

What bother? You reminded me that I need to finish the BinInstaller docs.

By the way, if you missed it the first time it was posted, here's a 
couple of examples showing a QuickTime movie and a medium-sized JPEG

If you do update the docs, I'll update the installer sniplet so it 
will detect and display an alert if there is not enough storage 
space. I told Halvor to double check, but he didn't immediatly, so 
there is a design flaw in the software.

Hi,

I just seem to keep bugging you guys...

I always, except for yesterday, have a problem starting NTK under Mac OS 
X. Actually, Yesterday I started to write a mail about it to the list and 
just tried to start it up to describe the error message, and then it 
worked! That lead me to start playing with the BinInstaller, as you know 
by now...  He-he.

But since then I have rebooted my system, and the error is there again.
"Could not start the application because of some unknown error"
Anyone else seen this?

You need a serial port. I guess that yesterday, you had your USB 
adapter plugged in. Plug it again, it should work.

Thanks,

But there are no hardware changes since yesterday.
I sync and upload packages to my newton without problems.
Could it be that the serial is registered to something else? I'll try.

Hi,

This information is intended if somone is searching this archive or if 
someone feels like appending it to the Newton FAQ.

If you have problems starting NTK under Mac OS X and get the earlier 
mentioned error message, uninstall the Keyspan USB Serial Adapter Software 
as described in the User Manual from Keyspan.
Use the Keyspan Serial Assistant tool that was put in /Applications during 
the install.

If you have software that needs the keyspan drivers you will have to 
install them again.

I'll try to work on the docs this weekend. They are currently a

Subject: [NPDS] Checking BinInstallers limitations

Hi,

I am still checking out BinInstallers limitations and experiencing my own. 
:-)

On the following URL I have made a WAV file of my Newton speaking some 
text that I stole from God knows where. The WAV file is about  1.8 MB.

Paul mentioned some limitations about the BinInstaller, but was that to 
the 1.0 version or the 1.11 version? 
Would it be possible to install this WAV file with the BinInstaller?
Yes, to av internal flash memory card this time...   ;-)

Is there any easier way to install this than copy/paste small chunks of 
HEX data to a ResEdit resource?

Hey, I really need this to meet Gregs challenge with his nice QuickTime 
movie served by his server!  :-)

The 1.0
For the 1.1, you need to have approximatively twice the size of the 
binary available on the defautl store. In fact less if it compresses 
well.

>Would it be possible to install this WAV file with the BinInstaller?
>Yes, to av internal flash memory card this time...   ;-)

Normally, yes, provided you have plenty of space. Also, this will 
take a lot of time. Be patient.

>Is there any easier way to install this than copy/paste small chunks of
>HEX data to a ResEdit resource?

Yes, you can use MPW or Rez on OS X.

MPW: (select and press the enter key, then choose the file)
echo "read 'DATA' (1000) "`GetFileName -m 'Fichier à convertir'`" ; 
" | Rez -o `GetFileName -p -m 'Résultat?'` -t 'rsrc' -c 'RSED'

OS X: (in the Terminal)
echo "read 'DATA' (1000) "\""File.wav"\"" ; " | Rez -o "File.rsrc" -t 
'rsrc' -c 'RSED'

Please note that the MPW version is a little bit smarter since it 
asks you which file to convert and where to create the resulting file 
with the resource. Also, it's localized in French :)

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce BinInstaller 1.2.

20/05/2003	Installer 1.2 [Paul Guyot]
- The installer template now displays an error message for every entry that
could not be saved to store.
- The installer template is now compressed on the Newton (I don't 
understand why
it wasn't).

It's on the NPDS website as usual (http://npds.free.fr).

Enjoy.

Subject: [NPDS] BinInstaller and 1,8Mb package

Hi,

When I try to install my huge 1,8 Mb BinInstaller (1.2) package the 
package is downloaded to my Newton alright but when the Newt is trying to 
install it I get the following error:

An error has occured activating the package "Bin Installer:Kallisys". It 
may not work with this system. Contact the software publisher for further 
information. (Part0, Type auto)

BugTrap dumps a log.

When I have a look at the "Binaries@Binary Server" store later I can see 
that there is installed 3 items on the external card and none internal.
I guess that the three items is my first 3 gifs that is included in the 
package. My 4th item, a wav file, is not present at the card.

For some reason I have to erase my external card if I have downloaded to 
it if I reboot or unmount & mount it again. I dont know if this is because 
of BinInstaller or if my PCMCIA card is "getting old" on me or something.

The BugTrap log is at: http://158.36.48.10/html/31898258$66.nsd

Subject: [NPDS] Client SSI script no longer works!

I noticed sometime after I upgraded to the newest version of the NPDS
modules on both my Newtons, that my "Client Status" scripts don't work
anymore?

I noticed on several other people's NPDS servers that their "Client Script"
doesn't work either.

It displays an error code on the resulting generated web page that says...

"Newtonscript Error: (#-48412) evt.ex.fr.type;type.ref.frame Data:"

OR

"Newtonscript Error: (#-48807) evt.ex.fr.intrp;type.ref.frame Symbol:
kAppSymbol"




Does anyone know what has caused this?

Paul removed the code that this SSI relies upon because it's not 
thread-safe. Essentially, the old code was a global frame where 
information about the current request was being stored - this was 
certainly OK when only one HTTP process at a time was possible, but as 
I gather that nHTTPd is becoming multi-threaded, this global thingy 
just isn't tenable anymore. After all, how would one KNOW which 
connection was populating this global data frame? I guess one could 
still have a global frame where state and client information about each 
connection was cached, as long as you had some sort of unique session 
ID assigned to each connection.

Then if the SSI code had knowledge of the session ID, it could query 
the global request frame and return the appropriate values for browser 
type, IP address, and so on.

Well, in fact, all I have to do is to provide the information about 
the request to the SSI script.

I don't know when, but I pushed down the knowledge of the request 
down to the ExecuteScript method. I do not recall why I did this, it 
is probably relative to look at the user agent for processing the 
HTML. Anyway.

Now (nHTTPd 2.104), instead of having a reference to nHTTPd which is 
quite pointless as the unique and normally ignored parameter of the 
SSI, I pass theRequest. I do not know if this will work with SSIs 
that are said to return static value, I should say I didn't dig this.

Please post the client SSI script (where can I find such a beast?) 
and I'll tweak it to work with nHTTPd 2.104. theRequest is not like 
the old request frame, it's closer to early work on NPDS 3.

Also, are there any volunteers for trying 2.104? I've fixed a bug and 
two incoherencies in the 2.104 candidate I had on my hard drive. For 
that purpose, I've drawn an UML state diagram. Sheesh, ok, please do 
not tell the software engineering teachers I had last year.

I'm doing my best to make it more stable than 2.103 which is not bad 
(but I lost its source code).

BTW, just discovered this.

I though I had a copy of this somewhere, but apparently not. Paul Filmer 
had to posted to his NPDS server, but it's offline at the moment. I am 
working on getting all of the SSI scripts posted on the NPDS development 
site very soon. Oh, yeah... along with the first draft of the 
BinInstaller instructions.

I'm game to try it. Is this 2.104 release any different than the one I'm 
running Paul?

There is a misunderstanding.

I wrote:

So what I offer is the one you tried without the bug and the two 
incoherencies. My bet is that it's even more stable than 2.103. I 
cannot tell how long my Newton was serving since I have this bad 
contact in the power adapter plug.

(I also reverted to 2.103 before leaving for Mexico).

replace with func(inUndocumentedRequestFrame) for NPDS 2.104 and higher.

>  begin
>  local theOut:="";
>  local theIP:="REMOTE_ADDR";

This (replacement of variables like this) is still supported (now I 
recall why I needed to push the request structure down). It might 
disappear with 3.x in favor of a direct access to the request frame.

>  local theDNS:="REMOTE_HOST";

This one is no longer supported. The name is resolved later (if ever, 
I do not recall), so when the script is called, the name is unknown.

>  local theBrowser:="HTTP_USER_AGENT";

This one should have worked, but there was a bug I've just fixed.
FYI, now, every header's content replaces HTTP_XXX texts (if there 
are several headers with the same name, the first one is chosen).

>  local theNewt:=|NPDS|:UsingNewtonBrowser();

This method changed. It relied on the global frame.
To use it, you need to do:
|NPDS|:UsingNewtonBrowser(inUndocumentedRequestFrame);
However, this requires latest 2.104 RC build and it is not supported 
since what you're doing here is calling a method from NPDS which 
could be removed at any time.
(|NPDS| was broken, I've just fixed it).

>  local theAncient:=|NPDS|:UsingAncientBrowser();

This method was removed.
The notion of AncientBrowser disappeared from NPDS.

>   theOut:=StrConcat(theOut,"<P><BR><H2> Your IP: " & theIP);

[You have a problem in your HTML code.]

>  theOut:=StrConcat(theOut,"<P><H2> Your DNS: " & theDNS);
>  theOut:=StrConcat(theOut,"<P><H2> Your Browser: " & theBrowser);

remove from here

>  else if theAncient then begin
>  theOut:=StrConcat(theOut,"You should update your browser...");
>  end;

to here.

>  theOut:=StrConcat(theOut,"<P><BR>");
>  return theOut;
>  end


So in the end, the script would be:
func(inUndocumentedRequestFrame)
begin
	local theResult :=
		"<p />\n"
		"<h2> Your IP: REMOTE_ADDR</h2>\n"
		"<h2> Your Browser: HTTP_USER_AGENT</h2>\n";
	if (|NPDS|:UsingNewtonBrowser(inUndocumentedRequestFrame)) then
		theResult := theResult & "You are using a Newton Browser!\n";
	return theResult & "<p />\n";
end;

I didn't explain why. This feature (replacing CGI variable names 
directly in script results) is nice but CPU intensive as it requires 
a parsing of every script output to look for the strings to replace. 
I'd prefer that the scripts access the variables and decide to 
include their values in the output (or do whatever they want with 
these values).

force Apple to stick to POSIX standards better than they actually do).

I've run a dummy script that makes requests on my NPDS server 
indefinitely. This is really stupid, it spans two processes everytime 
it goes through a loop, each doing a request with curl. I used such a 
script on a NetBSD box with lynx instead of curl. The output is 
redirected to /dev/null.

As long as NPDS was running, everything was fine. curl could not get 
as many pages as planned, the number of curl processes was limited by 
the shell as it should be in such a case, everything was fine.

Then, I stopped NPDS from the Newton. The effect was that curl 
processes returned immediatly (instead of waiting for a timeout). And 
this killed the Mac's UI server. It stopped being responsive (the 
mouse was still moving).

I logged from another machine: my script was no longer running 
(probably killed somehow by the kernel). I could do anything from 
this other machine. But if I killed graphical programs, they would 
remain zombies. The UI server was completely screwed up. I thought 
about taking a photo of my NPDS protoTCPEndpoint nice state diagram I 
did in Omnigraffle and I didn't save, but I didn't. Finally, I had to 
restart the machine (I didn't do it too brutally, I did a shutdown 
from the other machine).

I always do a fsck after a restart of my computer (which happens 
every week at most). In spite of the shutdown, a file was killed 
(fsck told me its size should be 0). But then MacOS X went completely 
nuts. Classic said there was an error and it crashed. Eudora which I 
just started crashed as well. And finally, I got a kernel panic (the 
mouse was still moving, though, I love this).

After the second restart, everything seems back to normal.

Did I mention my Newton was sitting still during all this time?

BTW, I did a similar experience from a code snippet that Paul Filmer 
sent me. It's supposed to kill down a Palm with an echo packets flood 
attack. After adaptation so it would work on my mac, I tried it on my 
Newton. The result is:
- my mac's TCP/IP stack during the attack was not very responsive.
- NPDS was not responsive (from my Mac and from another machine), 
probably because NIE was too busy.
- the Newton was however perfectly ok.
- few seconds after I stopped the attack, NPDS was serving pages again.

I think it's time to install nessus for NPDS stability checks. It 
will be better than my home-made killer scripts.

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce nHTTPd 2.104.

It should be more stable than 2.103. I suggest running latest watcher as well.

This is what Grant says about it:
>I haven't run into any issues. A few connection dropped messages, but no
>BugTrap reports or freezes since I installed it Thursday evening. Seems
>to work well with the Watcher. I'd suggest that it's ready to go.

This is what Josh says about it:
>I think it is as stable, if not more so, than 2.103, and encourage 
>you to make it the an "official" release for the other NPDS users. 
>Works fine with the Watcher, and no Communications errors.

What's new:
16/06/2003	2.104 [Paul Guyot]
	Changed the NPDS URL.
	Reworked the finite state machine of the server.
	Fixed bugs in SSI parsing.
	The parameter of the SSIs is not the request.
		Backward compatibility in NPDS 3 is not guaranteed.
	Fixed other bugs I don't recall about.

As usual, this is available with source code on NPDS new website 
(http://npds.free.fr/)

 From now ongoing, I'll only provide bug fixing and security updates 
:) for the NPDS 2.x branch.

Regards,

Paul

Hello Newtonians

First time poster, short time lurker.

My question: In reference to this upgrade, is the recommended method of 
upgrading simply to delete the old modules and install the newer, or is 
there some further step I should take? (ie prefs cleaner) I am way 
short on the basics of newton operation.

I have had trouble running nHTTPd on my 2100 from behind my airport for 
quite a while. I was re-exploring the problem, and had found a 
reference to a post from a person with the same problem. ("An error 
occured in endpoint connect. A communications problem occured. 
Connection may have been dropped, Error - 16013".)  (for the record, I 
know this refers to the modem not responding, but I am using an orinoco 
silver card on my wireless network.)

He replied that he never resolved it, nor did he hear from anyone.

Then last weekend, at way too late in the morning to be working on such 
a thing, I had a meltdown with my newton and lost my data. As I am 
using it for just playing around, I will just start from scratch. I was 
psyched to see that many updates and fixes had been released just from 
November of last year when I started my Newton Odyssey. I hope to see 
you all out there....

thanks for suggestions,


DVS

You can just install these packages over an existing NPDS set.
We actually advise two NPDS sets:
- supported ones (look on the page, supported version)
- latest ones.
Don't mix both and don't use very old package with the most recent 
ones. There will be some incompatibilities.

Try to get latest release. It eliminates many of the problems.
If you still have issues, please install BugTrap and enable exception catching.

I have a Lucent silver card behind an Airport station (yesterday a 
first generation, now an Airport Extreme one). And it works 
perfectly. I know other users with a similar setup.

Sorry to hear about your data loss (makes me think I should do a backup).
Yes, Newton development is not totally dead, although I often wish it 
were more active.

I had never heard of 'nessus'. It does sound interesting. And they have a

Hi all,

I realize I forgot to mention that one should better restart his 
Newton after installing nHTTPd 2.104.

This is because some of the previous versions had a bad bug that 
somewhat nuked the Newton's TCP/IP stack.

Hi all,

I've just realized I sent Matvey a 2.102b while in fact, I never 
published 2.101. So 2.101 will include the fix I brought to fix his 
issues with nHTTPd 2.104. Matvey, the only difference with the 
package I sent to you is that this one was built after yours and say 
2.101 instead of 2.102.

NoteServ is on the website as usual (http://npds.free.fr/).

The changes are the following:
>20/06/2003	2.101 [Paul Guyot]
>	Now serves ink text embedded into notes.
>	Fixed the about box bug (Grant, Wed, 19 Mar 2003 19:26:02 -0700)
>	Fixed a bug about Notes with no name.

I just have to wish you happy embedded-ink serving, I guess.

Well, after nearly a full week of running 2.104 - only having the Watcher 
reboot and restart things once in a while - NPDS just stopped responding. 
No dialog boxes. No BugTrap reports. No freezing. Nothing. Stopping and 
starting NPDS got things going again. I'm thinking that the Watcher 
missed something or was fooled into thinking that everything was fine.

I wish I had more information to share, but there really isn't anything. 
It's almost better when things really blow up big time, and all sorts of 
error messages appear on screen. :)

Other than that, a most lovely release.

Subject: [NPDS] Tracker client error?
From: John Skinner <nospam_john_at_johnskinner_dot_net>

Hello everyone,

I noticed that my Newton wasn't on the tracker today so I went to reboot my
Newton. After rebooting it, NPDS started up O.K. Then I went back to the
Tracker web page (http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:3680) and it still was
not there.

Now let me say that I haven't changed anything on the Newton or anything
else on my network.

So, I went back to the NPDS Tracker Client to check the configuration, and I
decided to enable "Tell me about server's 4xx errors" (config screenshot
below).
http://www.johnskinner.net/config.gif

Then when I tried to register to the server, I received an error (error
screenshot below).
http://www.johnskinner.net/error.gif

So now I can not register on the Tracker server!
Anyone care to speculate why this might be happening?

Hi John!

Did you try using your router's real IP as a test to see if it just 
doesn't like using your DNS host?

I assume you are using NAT and port forwarding web requests to your 
newton?

As a test, I just went in to my server room (the spare room with the 
piano and the crystal castles video game)
and changed my IP in my tracker config from a numeric IP to a DNS entry 
I use from a free DNS service (newtonserver.no-ip.com) and it worked 
fine.

This leads me to believe its your DNS.

I also notice that, much like me, you tackled this problem after 1AM.

Everyone knows Newton Men stay up late.

It should have been back sooner, but I forgot to change the path to the Java

No, I didn't. I did notice today though that it just started registering
corectly on it's own. Strange...

Well, at least a few of us do anyway!

Thanks! I had always intended to put way more detailed Newton information
and "How-To's" up  on it, but you know how that whole "free time" thing
goes.

Someday I will get to it though, and have screenshots (Mac & Newton) for
every step of the way. I even thought of also making downloadable PDF copies
too!

Later!

Hi,

Newly arrived npds installer here ...... experiencing a problem..........
can you render some assistance with the following problemO ......

The tracker client is succesful logging into "npds-tracker.continuity.cx",
but, after a few seconds it soon automatically disconnects and returns the
following message:

Tracker Client
Oops, the server returned an error:

400 Bad Request host address is for private network (check you client
configuration)

What haven't I done with client configuration?

Thanks,

From: Josh Burker <nospam_senorwences_at_mac_dot_com>

It would appear that your Newton is on a LAN, correct?

What the Tracker is reporting is that you are attempting to use a 
non-routing IP address (ie 192.168.x.x, 10.0.0.x, etc) with which to be 
tracked.  This will not work, and the Tracker is reporting the error.

In the Tracker configuration (accessible from the nHTTPd package), you 
need to check the box "Newton is on a LAN (behind a gateway)" and then 
give it a public IP address (the IP address assigned to you by your 
ISP) in the field below:  do not include the port number that NPDS is 
serving on.

Make sure your router is configured to pass http requests to port 80 or 
port 8080 or port 8088, depending on how you have your NPDS configured. 
  Your NPDS should register with the Tracker using its public IP address 
(the address assigned to you by your ISP) and if the router is properly 
configured it will pass the requests to your NPDS.

HTH,

Josh

Exactly what I wrote.
The page said it was incompatible and shouldn't be used. But it 
referred to 0014ac. 0101ac, the latest watcher, is not incompatible 
with nHTTPd 2.104.

From: David Schultz <nospam_evil_genius_at_mac_dot_com>


Not a Newton post per se, but an OT musing to share with like minded  
zealots such as yourselves. I hope you will indulge me.

When I first started looking into buying a used Newton I was an Apple  
Store Manager/Mac Genius. It was behind the genius bar, beneath the  
poster of Richard Feynman that this plan was born.

I am building my classic dream.

The eye: From a bygone era, last of the mac compatible video cams  
before the long dry spell recently broken by the isight:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/ 
eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2739041827&category=25449&rd=

The brain: I purchased one of these on ebay when sonnet offloaded some  
surplus at a decent price. I waited calmly and patiently to acquire it,  
and likewise It has been sitting in its box patiently for 2 years. It  
brings the Color Classic up to 32 MB of RAM and Quadra 68040 speeds.

http://www.sonnettech.com/product/presto_plus.html

The body: The sonnet upgrade will be nestled sweetly in this "new"  
Color Classic, as my old one began having video problems. It will  
capture the video, and host the images and hold them for the web  
server. All must be perfect for this sweet dream to come true.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/ 
eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=4610&item=2733019160

And the crown shall be my Newton 2100 to serve it all. I am thinking of  
purchasing another 2100, strictly to wipe and setup with NPDS to see if  
I can work out the performance issues I am having. I cannot seem to  
keep mine online for more than a short while. I thought of testing,  
uninstalling software, installing bugtrack as Grant suggested. But for  
this to work as I dreamed of, I need to be certain the newton will be  
able to be counted on. So I think I will start fresh with

This web server, patiently collected, with its webcam, ftp, css and  
dazzling quadra-esque speed will do little more than what many other  
computers will do, but it will do it in pure, unblemished 1993 style.

Thanks Josh for your clear explanation as always.

Michael, I know the tracker server could be aggressive with this 
message and that some trackers in the galaxy aren't that strict, but 
it's for your own good. If you register with a local address like 
10.0.1.203 (my Newton's actual IP), the tracker server and everyone 
on the Internet will not be able to access it.

Once you got the concept, the next step if you have a dynamic address 
provided by a DHCP server is to put a dyndns client on a machine in 
your LAN (specifying to use the external IP, on MacOS X, I suggest 
DNSUpdate) and then to open an account and putting the address in the 
tracker client next to the Public IP field. Java 2-powered trackers 
will be able to track you even if your IP changed, provided that your 
dyndns client updated the IP of course.

You have latest modules of everything?
NPDS isn't stable, but the watcher will restart it and it should be 
able to serve pages for 2 weeks without human intervention. The NPDS 
modules web page used to say that Watcher is incompatible, it's true 
with 0014ac, but it's not true with 0101ac, I fixed this recently.

I know it's not as good as Apache. The TCP/IP stack isn't as good either.

I read that the watcher was incompatible with the latest version, and read
not to use it?

Subject: [NPDS] Trackers don't seem to be up...
From: David Schultz <nospam_evil_genius_at_mac_dot_com>

Saturday afternoon here EST and Shakti seems to be down (or 
intermittent) no newts on mymacs tracker, and only 2 on Misato.

Also, I wanted to send big thank you's to Paul and to others for 
helping me get my npds stable. Paul pointed me to the recent update to 
npds watcher and this has helped me stay up and serving for a solid 
week (one minor downtime when my airport base station needed a hard 
rest, word to the wise, export your settings on your base station and 
save them, really saves time)
Thanks to Grant for the heads up about web*pager, updating that to 2.1 
fixed it as well.

shakti is actually off for several months now and was replaced with amaterasu.
http://npds-tracker.continuity.cx:3180 works here.

However, we are aware of a problem from the ISP. That's why there was 
no NTLK mail since this morning, GMT time. They're mostly waiting on 
the box. The box is reachable but can only reach few machines.
Look at:

Bill Shamam is trying to contact the ISP but their phone service 
doesn't reply. He also sent an e-mail.

I second this wisdom.

Glad that you seem to be a happy NPDS user.

OK, I've understood
- why you think amaterasu was down.
- why amaterasu couldn't reach most Newtons.

Both reasons are linked. The ISP told us that their IPs will move. 
Normally, all this should have happened smoothly. But since this 
morning, there were these issues. They said they had some fire/fiber 
cut at their upstream provider for the old IPs. The result is that 
the old IPs of the machine didn't work and since they were the 
default route, the machine couldn't reach us, except some Canadian 
talented typographer fan of spiral logos (did I mention the ISP is in 
Canada?).

I changed the IP of npds-tracker.continuity.cx a while back. But 
there is that bug in NIE that keeps cache 60 times too long. So if 
you don't have the NIE Patch that fixes this 
(http://www.kallisys.com/newton/rustines/), I suggest deleting the 
Internet DNS Cache soup and then try to register again. Installing 
the patch will not fix the problem. You need to delete the soup 
anyway. Beware of not deleting the wrong soup (I say this because I 
once deleted the Internet Setup soup while working on the NIE patch).

Even if you have this patch, the semi-downtime of the box was long 
enough to lose tracks of all newton servers. So you'll have to 
re-register.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Well, actually it wasn't that funny when it didn't work.

I think it is version 3.

I noticed I was having this problem too. The funnt thing is that I have had
Your NIE patch since I rebuilt this Newton, and it still didn't register

Subject: [NPDS] Changing stores (from card to internal)
Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 07:06:00 +1000

Hi,

Sorry for a Newbie question. I installed NPDS on an 8Mb card and I am 
getting a number of errors (usually telling me that the card is locked 
- which it isn't) and I can't view the logs at all. I figured maybe I 
could move the application into the internal store to try getting 
around the problem. Obviously I could reinstall the app but having 
started down the configuration route already, it would be nice to 
preserve what is there.

What's the problem then? Well I note in the instructions that you have 
to be careful to make sure the components are started in the right 
order (to get the stores created) and I also am wondering about the 
internal references in the pages (because they relate to soups).

So, can I just move the packages and stores internally? Or should I 
scrub it and reinstall?

Thanks,

Jon

The view take a lot of space. Maybe your card is full?
What kind of card is it?

Yes. The best is to reboot the Newton before restarting NPDS after 
such a move, although it's definitely not required.

However, make sure NPDS isn't running when do you perform such a 
move. I mean it's just better to make sure, once again, it's not 
required, theoretically, NewtonOS is robust enough to allow this kind 
of things.

If you move pages between stores and if you built links in the VFS or 
whatever Matt called it format (i.e. < entry id >$< store id >.nsd), 
the links will no longer work. However, it should be ok to move items 
between stores. Make sure you emptied the cache before restarting 
NPDS.

From: John Skinner <nospam_john_at_johnskinner_dot_net>

I noticed Paul Filmer's NPDS server on the Tracker last night!

It's been a while since I've seen it up, and it looks like he made some
changes to his content.

He has fixed the "Client" script to work with NPDS 2.104!


Thanks Paul!

It looks like he's got a nBlog server running on it too!

Thanks Paul for the advice....

Unfortunately I stuffed it up (forgot to move the main package which 
was on the menu bar) and had to reinstall anyway. The card was an 8Mb 
flash card (NewtonWorld). I will retry with the logging and hope that 
it works.

Thanks again.,

The script Paul Filmer wrote, was posted it on his NPDS server. But, his
server is rarely up these days. He had both versions there (1 for pre 2.1, &
1 for 2.1-up).

I copied the new one for 2.1-up, and here it is...

-----------------

func(inUndocumentedRequestFrame)
begin
local theResult :=
"

\n"
"

Your IP Address is: REMOTE_ADDR

\n";
if (|NPDS|:UsingNewtonBrowser(inUndocumentedRequestFrame)) then
theResult := theResult & ""You are using a Newton browser!\n";
return theResult & "


\n"";
End

----------------



Hope this helps!

I cannot take the credit for this, since I'm quite sure I simply copied it
from a post (to this list). I'm betting it's Paul G that should get the
credit...

My server is usually up, but not often tracked. I don't know nuffink.

I have been suggesting for a while about such a thing. One place for all
things NPDS: scripts, tricks, settings, how-to's etc.

I guess I could kinda take this on (or help if someone else would like to
step in).

I do have this wonderful Newted account that I haven't done anything with
yet!

For now though, You can find some scripts and stuff on Paul Filmers NPDS
server at

http://128.150.4.33/html/-88186101$25.nsd

And on my NPDS server

http://ndutyme.staticcling.org:8088/html/279004559$54.nsd

Ideally, we want to have all resources for NPDS available on the NPDS 
site as well. I can add links to John and Paul's sites to the NPDS page, 
but ultimately I would like to have mirrored them on a non-NPDS server as 
well. (Not that NPDS isn't a stable serving platform ;)

This was discussed on this list a couple of months ago, but a few other 
things got on my to do list ahead of it. John, I think you and I had 
chatted about it too.

I would be more than happy to post anything you put together, or else I 
can slurp up version of the stuff posted to your NPDS server. I have 
already asked Paul Filmer about mirroring his information.

I do remember talking before about this with you Grant.

Ultimately, I do agree with you that these kinda things should be available
at the NPDS home site.

I know how it is with priorities and time. I too seem to have much more
things to do and not enough time to do them.

Ever since I have been a Newton user (only about 4 years now) I have wanted
to contribute something back to the Newton community. I know that I always
wanted to find some great "how-to's" with pictures/screenshots for many of
the things I was trying to figure out about my Newton when I was learning
the ropes. I feel that this is my calling.

With some help from a few smart editors (your self included) I would like to
make some "how-to's" to be used by the Newton community.

My available time is limited, and I have my first baby on the way!, but I
really want to make time to do this.

I hope I can pull through on this one!

--Apple-Mail-17-19943145
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII;	format=flowed

First thing first! I would like to publicly thank both Paul Guyot and 
Richard Sheppard for helping me out with questions and feedback. 
Richard in particular was able to help me get the css out of the Newt 
and functional. I understand (after more research) that I can in fact 
store the css in a note and once I have tweaked it, I will do so. In 
the meantime, I have the front page with a similar look and feel to my 
blog.

Now onto the main point of this request. I want to extend the look and 
feel to more than just colours and fonts. I want to create (or use) 
templates for pages that I generate (other people's pages - submitted 
via Whiteboard are another kettle of fish). There may be a much better 
way to do this (and feel free to tell me I am an indiot for trying to 
do it this way) BUT....

What I am trying to do is to break up a page into components so that I 
can eventually provide a template for all the notes. I could go digging 
around in the source but that would be too much like hard work :-) for 
someone who spends all their time in perl and Unix.....

If you check out my current home page on the Newton 
(http://www.guru-international.com:8080) I have affectively four 
components in a table: a header, a footer, a menu (on the right) and a 
body (on the left). I would like to store these as separate notes so 
that they can be reused (so that clicking on a note for example would  
generate a page with the same header/footer/menu but a different body).

Having carefully read the details in the 4AA magazine and the notes on 
the npds web site, I am guessing that I could generate SSI's to create 
the data. If I had an SSI that returns the cell details for the header 
then I could just include that and so on. The problem is that the SSI's 
themselves are non-trivial to manage compared to notes.

One solution that I can see would be to write an SSI that returned the 
contents of a note. Something along the lines of:

func(nullVar)
begin
local theOut;
theOut:= GetContents("html/menu%20bar");
return theOut;
end

The problem with this is that I have no idea what "GetContents" would 
look like.

One alternative would be to override the (presumably) existing 
templates (note that when you click on a note you get the note plus a 
footer which is inserted by an SSI).

Any suggestions or solutions would be much appreciated.

Can't you handle this with CSS?

GetRoot().|pHTML:MAVON|:fRetrieveNamedNote("menu%20bar");
or
GetRoot().|pHTML:MAVON|:fRetrieveNamedNote("menu bar");

Remark #1: this requires NoteServ
Remark #2: although untested, this should work but this is not 
guaranteed to work with future versions (although if I break this, 
I'll try to provide you with a better "GetContents"-like interface).
Remark #3: if note called "menu bar" is not considered as HTML by 
NPDS (well, NoteServ), especially if it has no html suffix as you 
mention it here and no html header or stuff like this, it will be 
converted to HTML.

Consequently, I suggest using names with an HTML suffix (.htm, .html, 
.css, .js).

>One alternative would be to override the (presumably) existing 
>templates (note that when you click on a note you get the note plus

Indeed. You can override the footer's SSI, <HOME>. This is how I get 
the two links in notes instead of one.
The code is: | Return to <HOME> |
There is no way to get rid of | Return to | except by a very dirty 
hack (not that overriding <HOME> is not a dirty hack) or changing the 
code of NoteServ.

I just realized I have plenty of scripts on my Newton. As soon as you

Hint received.

Dump them in this directory as text files for now:

ftp://ftpperso.free.fr/scripts/

I will set up some sort of templated index page this weekend.

I think the issue is that you *can* use CSS to modify the overall look 
and feel of the page background color and the font styles, but you 
*cannot* use CSS alone to add a standard navigation bar (for example) to 
every NoteServ-based page. This is where include files come in.

Well now, isn't that a slick idea... Hmmm.

		[NPDS] Re: Using SSI to create templates

----------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Jon Wright <nospam_jgw_at_mac_dot_com>
Subject: [NPDS] Re: Using SSI to create templates
Date: Sun, 19 Oct 2003 00:49:22 +1000

Originally, I asked about ways to rebuild the NPDS index page using 
'include' files (and presumably css). Thanks to Richard Sheppard, Paul 
Guyot and Grant Hutchinson, I now have the guts of this working (some 
fine tuning required).

Pictures of the results can be seen from a blog entry: 
http://ozguru.typepad.com/gday_mate/2003/10/oznewton_update.html

Key is a couple of SSI's that look like this (Paul's code):

func(nullVar)
begin
     local theOut;
     theOut:= GetRoot().|pHTML:MAVON|:fRetrieveNamedNote("menu.html");
     return theOut;
end

BTW, this might be obvious to all you Newt hackers o ut there but the 
pHTL:MAVON has a vertical pipe '|' at the start and the end, not an 'I' 
or 'l'. All three look the same in the font I am using :-(

Then instead of using the table, I used some css code which creates a 
floating menu. The long term idea is that I can now create new pages of 
content with the same menu via a simple include statement (the SSI 
function above). When I want to change say the email address I can edit 
a single note (or overwrite one).

I still need to do a lot more tuning on the css but the concept is 
complete and it is almost 1AM and I have work to do tomorrow ....

Thanks to everyone for their help.

Recently I launched a test application by mistake that sent update inquiries
to all 3000+ contacts from my Names soup - apologies to all, this was not
meant to be a mass e-mail.

Ain't automation grand.

Paul F., who will go back into hiding now, and reconsider his habit of
putting _every_ e-mail address he comes across into his Newt.

No worries Paul. Since I knew who you were, I took the opportunity to 
update my contact information. Use it in good health.

Yes, Grant, You are.  Now, let me talk to you about a sum of US$20,3
million, recently left to me by a foreigner, who died yesterday in an
accident on the Sagbama Express road...

Thanks - now to see if I want to shell out the $49/year for the auto updates

Thanks Paul. I'll work on getting these presented on some sort of index 
page. While easily downloadable, the text files don't always display the 
proper formatting in the browser.

I haven't heard from Dan since back in June. The last time he was on this 
list was in January after his server and the tracker were down for a 
while after a move. You could try emailing him directly 
<nospam_lt_dan_at_alltel_dot_net> as I'm not sure if he is still subscribed to this 
list or not. Maybe Paul knows if he is.

>Pardon me if this is not proper material for the list. I was just curious.

No worries. If it has to do with NPDS or the trackers, then it's proper 
for the list. It's actually quite refreshing to have a message come 
across on this list every once in a while.

I noticed Paul Filmer's NPDS server on the Tracker last night!

It's been a while since I've seen it up, and it looks like he made some
changes to his content.

He has fixed the "Client" script to work with NPDS 2.104!


Thanks Paul!

It looks like he's got a nBlog server running on it too!

The problem is the space. You can either rename the directory with 
your image in newtonmuse.com or put %20 in the address on your 
Newton, as in:

<img alt="serve-npds4-1.gif"

Subject: [NPDS] german users with NPDS ? wireless ? 

Hello !

Re-thinking about an internet-connection
for my green 2100.

Should also work as a NPDS...

Recently was electrified about the wireless
possibilities.

Drawback: only Classic MacOS 8.6 here, 
so no use of Apple Airport.

plan: want to buy a wireless ADSL Router
to connect my Macs, my Linux Notebook and
my greens to internet...

Any german users on this list ? 
Who have been successfully connect 
their green by use of a ADSL - Router 
to T-DSL ? 

maybe in conjunction with Classic MacOS or
a small Linux Notebook ? 


Thanks for any input !
still tapping around in the dark....

Congratulations from Down Under as well.

Big question - do you use the auto-reboot option to keep it on the air? 
I find that it restarts too often (when there is no problem) and fails 
to load the ethernet driver on reboot (so no connectivity)....

I do indeed.

However, I have NPDS on the ATA card while the Linksys driver is on 
the Internal store. I know that ethernet problems are often linked 
with timings. What problem do you have exactly? Does some error pops 
out? Theoretically, NPDS Watcher will try several times to launch 
NPDS.

Also, I noticed I have nHTTPd 2.105rc1 installed. For nearly 6 
months.  Without posting it on the website. I simply forgot about it.

Apparently (according to my e-mail database), the change since 2.104 
included a bug fix when the preferences could be somewhat eaten. 
Something Matvey experienced. I can't recall at all. I'm going to 
post it once I'll have compared with 2.104 source code.

I also noticed that 100166 cannot be displayed properly (while 100165 
or 100175 can). I'll fixed that one, too, and package that as 2.105, 
unless someone wants some other feature/bug fix for 2.105. Maybe I'll 
fix the -8007 when the icon is tapped from the Extras drawer while 
being minimized.

Paul, you remember my name - wow! I guess this is my cue to ask this 
question - meant to do it for a long time... A while back I switched 
routers on my network and ever since my Newton refuses to engage 
Ethernet drivers. Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?

I have an MP2100. The card is 3Com EtherLink III, model 3C589D (it 
worked just fine for a pretty long time and I checked it in my PC 
laptop after the Newton began being uncooperative - it seems fine). 
When I try to initiate a connection (any connection - NPDS, web 
browser, Dock via TCP/IP), it says "Connecting," the green light on 
the card's dongle comes on and then turns off. Sometimes the whole 
thing hangs, sometimes I get errors. Right now the error is -60088. I 
can never get a connection.

Help?!?

I have the exact same setup that you have (MP2100 and a 3Com Etherlink III
model 3C589D). This happened to me as well, and I know what the problem is.

I Think the network card (being 10 Megabit only) doesn't play well with
network switches and/or auto sensing 100 or 1000 Megabit hubs.

I had to get a hold of an old 10 Megabit hub to put between my Newton and
the rest of my network, just to make it work.

Perhaps someone else here could explain why in more technical detail.

Hope this helps!

FYI, you can look up error numbers in the NewtonOS Error Database:

http://toronto.unna.org/errors/

This particular error's symbol is kInetToolErrDhcpReqFailed - which in plain 
english means your Newton couldn't find (or send) an DHCP request to get an IP 
address on the network.

Well, auto-sensing just doesn't always work, especially between different 
brands of hardware or cheap hardware.

Maybe... problem is that I only have one PCMCIA Ethernet card anymore, and it 
stays in my main Newt for the most part so I can connect at work.  However 
I've also been using IrDA and Eck's tools quite a lot to install packages and 
move data, so once I can make a RAS PPP connection from Win2k to my Newton, I 
can slap the Ethernet card into the backup and broadcast that sweet Newton 
vibe from the true north once again.

Also I can't use my old wireless RangeLAN2 stuff anymore, since it won't work 
with newer Linux kernels and I can't reliably get it to work with WinXP either 
(the only two desktop OSes I have at home anymore).  I'll be buying some 
802.11b hardware soon I think.

Hi everybody,

I'm unable to install the sample scripts package, it fails with either 
Mac NCU (went to death - Mac OS restart req.) or NPI (waitin for a long 
time - connection error), same goes for Newton DIL Tester on Windows.

Any thoughts?!?

Btw: I wanted to replace the always down mymacs.net tracker...

java takes one argument, the name of the class (without .class).
So you probably want to do:

/usr/lib/java/jre/bin/java npdstracker

The tracker actually needs a lifting.

 From npds.free.fr, downloaded it twice to be sure, but nothin.
Does it contain the example scripts from M. Vaughn? I've got his packages...

It is the same set of scripts, but the packages are different - although 
this may be due to Paul recompiling the package from Matt's source. I 
don't think that there is any reason why you couldn't use Matt's package 
with the current NPDS packages. However, if there is something wrong with 
the package on the NPDS site, we should replace it.

Paul, do you want to do this or shall I?

The corrupted NPDS-Scripts package has been replaced on the NPDS site. 
While I was at it, I also added the same package to the source code 
archive in that directory. May as well be consistent, right?

Hi folks,

I've launched a new NPDS Tracker Server to replace the currently down 
mymacs.net tracker.
The URL is npds-traq.xonxion.net and both ports 3680 and 8080 are in 
use, my server is located in Germany.

Paul and Victor, would you both please add my server to your syncing and 
link lists for sharing of records?
And thank you Paul for your little Java hint... ;-)

I would appreciate any assistance with the problem of getting my npds
server up and running ......

Actually the server is up and running just fine. Unfortunately the tracker
client returns the follow error message - "An error occurred in Endpoint
Connect. A communications problem occurred. Connection may have been
dropped. Error = 16013.

Here is my set-up ...

DSL connection
D-Link router for home LAN
I set the router to provide virtual server for the newton npds with a
private IP # .

I see that the "preferences" in the Tracker Client needs a Public IP #.
Unfortunately my DSL setup neither uses dynamic IP address or static IP
address, but, something called PPPoE?

Any suggestions?

Your DSL provider indeed assignes you a dynamic IP
address - go to http://www.whatismyip.com/ to see what
it is right now. This is the address you're supposed
to give in Tracker preferences. Keep in mind that if
your router reconnects to DSL provider (may happen
infrequently or very frequently, depending on provider
and myriad of other things), your IP address will
change, and you'll have to update the Tracker
preferences again.

I'll let someone else talk about the virtues of
dyndns.org...

Go to www.dyndns.org (most popular service), register for a new account, 
select a hostname with toplevel domain (i.e. dyndns.org) for you (the 
FAQ there could tell you more) and either your D-Link router supports 
registration to some dyndns service at connect or get some client to 
update your hostname record (look at the FAQ mentioned above for clients).

Then enter your selected hostname in the tracker client prefs and your 
done (hopefully)...
If not, don't hesitate to ask more questions. :-)

Greets,
Manu

Awesome Manuel.

I've added you server to the list of trackers on the NPDS home page. I 
have also removed the reference to Dan Claessens' server until such a 
time as it becomes available again.

Thanks for your support!
