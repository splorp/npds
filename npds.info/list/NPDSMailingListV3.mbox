Anyone had any thoughts (or even success's) with serving Tibetan pictures?
Can this be done with   Npds scripting capabilities?

Thanks

I haven't had any experience with Tibet, but I figured that someone 
should post a reply to make it appear as if this list is active. Now, 
back to the topic at hand... I am interested in finding a CoolPix 900 or 
950 camera and giving Tibet a try. What camera are you using Charles?

There was some discussion of this and even some progress on the serving 
front in 1999 when I was developing NPDS 2.0. Tibet stores its images as 
big binary JPEG files in a soup. I tried to get it working but lacking a) 
a fast newton b) a digital camera and c) free time I never got much done. 
But it's certainly doable. Basically, someone should be able to convert 
the source for Paul Guyot's binary server to serve up images from your 
Tibet image soup with a little effort.

Cheers,

I don't have a digital camera nor free time (but this is just a 
normal condition here). However, if someone tells me what's the 
format of Tibet Soup, I'll make the change to binary server.

I remind you that binary server is experimental and unsupported. 
Nevertheless, there are some good pages about it on the web (I think 
it's John's note about it that I remember of).

Also, Binary Server sends all the binary at once, and NewtonOS 
communication layer isn't very fond of it if it's too big (now that I 
think about it, this could be a problem with the GIF server as well).

Subject: [NPDS] Towards NPDS 3: themes and structure

Hi all,

Just a thought I had under the shower (why would I take showers if I 
hadn't crazy thoughts there?).

NPDS 3 will not simply be a new kernel. It should be a real 
improvement of NPDS, more personal and easier to use.

It could come with a set of themes (css, templates) of personal data server
i.e. new user would just have to install the various packages, do a 
quick setup of the server (port, admin password, name & other tracker 
client information), choose a theme and the Newton will automatically 
serve pages according to this theme. Of course, it has to be 
gorgious, follow W3C standards and readable with Newtscape/NetHopper.

A theme would be a set of css, template files & pictures giving a 
style to the server. For example I thought there could be one making 
the server look like a Newton (with the NotePad decoration and so on).

In fact, there would be integrated a theme prefs where you would 
choose between package-themes coming with NPDS (or from third 
parties), and personal theme, directly from NotePad/binary servers, 
thus allowing full customization of all that.

What do you think?

and

If you think it's a good idea, are there any volunteering & talented 
webdesigners wishing to make some static pseudo-NPDS server following 
a given theme?

Also, I think we should discuss about the structure of NPDS-3 
servers. There are things we should keep as is, I think, and things 
that should change or be replaced.

I guess that we need:
* some functionality like the pager (the pager has to be entirely 
redesigned, for example it should store pages in a soup and open 
itself automatically after a restart if it wasn't closed)
Maybe the pager soup could simply be In/OutBox?
* some functionality to simply serve pages (from the 
NotePad/NewtWorks), with inline graphics (so you can serve very 
simply a note)
* the dates and cardfile servers (probably need some little changes 
and they should benefit from new techs such as HTTP authentication)
* some way to serve screen shots
* the tracker client of course

The big thing I would like to discuss with you is the Note-posting 
capability and forum-like (or guest-book like) feature. I have 
several ideas, but maybe I should listen from your suggestions first.

Paul

Crazy thoughts? Not likely. You must have some spare time coming up, 
Paul. Your Newton-based activity level has popped up again.

Yes. Oh, yes.

I am liking where this is heading. Online weblogging and self-publishing 
products like Blogger, Movable Type, and Radio Userland work this way. 
All of them have the capability of using predesigned themes or custom 
user-defined ones, which can be selected on the fly. Radio Userland, in 
fact, also operates as a local HTTP server as well, so you can see 
exactly what you're going to get once the site is published.

Creating a set of page templates (perhaps identifying and separating out 
common page elements such as headers, footers, navigation bars, copyright 
notices, etc. into individual include files), style sheets, and 
associated graphic files would be a fairly easy task. Making sure that 
they validate in terms of W3C HTML (or XHTML) and CSS, would be a given.

I would be willing to create several base templates and themes for the 
project. First of all, I would need to document all of the various types 
of templates required (error pages vs. content display pages; CardServ 
vs. NoteServ pages; posting forms, confirmation notices, etc.) I don't 
suppose that there is any documentation of what pages currently get 
generated by NPDS is there? Of course, if we're redeveloping the entire 
base of NPDS services and functions, then the page and template list will 
be different.

Paul, is there going to be any issue with NPDS 3.0 serving up multiple 
files from the soup for a given page? Potentially, there could be a dozen 
or two file associated with any given theme-based page served up. Just 
wondering.

Hello. Let me introduce myself... :)

I don't use the pager very much, but I suppose I would if some changes 
were made. That being said, I'd like to see a larger Newton-side 
interface for one. Again, I like the idea of using the In/Out box as the 
interface to the pager soup. It just seems that many of the NPDS 
components maintain their own way of handling files and content. The more 
of these that can be combined into the common system wide interfaces such 
as Notes or In/Out, the better.

>* some functionality to simply serve pages (from the

>simply a note)

Is there any way we can improve the way NPDS distinguishes between a 
plain text (or lightly styled, like bolded or sized text...) note from 
one that contains pure HTML content? Specifically, I guess I'm interested 
to see how intelligent NPDS can be in terms of parsing the content of a 
note and how it wraps that content in a template. Does this make sense?

>* the dates and cardfile servers (probably need some little changes 
>and they should benefit from new techs such as HTTP authentication)

Authentication would be useful for allowing the admin to control server 
functions or plug-in prefs. I like the idea of a web-based remote admin 
system for all components of the server.

>* some way to serve screen shots

No argument here. How about live-streaming animated gifs? :)

>The big thing I would like to discuss with you is the Note-posting 
>capability and forum-like (or guest-book like) feature. I have

I would be interested specifically in different ways of displaying the 
posted notes. Sort order, with time stamping, number of posts listed 
using the SSI tag, etc. Being able to thread a series of posts, or at 
having a reply to a post directly linked to the original somehow would be 
useful.

Here's a couple other things to consider:

* server logging and reporting
* integration of NPDS Watcher
* web-based binary file uploading
* Notes folder browser

Whew.

Once again, Grant, I have to take the dictionary to learn a new 
expression you're using. Except that this time, I did not find 
anything into any of my dicts. What do you mean "[It] would be a 
given."? Maybe something is missing there?

(BTW, I quite enjoy having to learn new expressions).

I thought that we could work together on this. I mean, we could all 
say what kind of interface we want from the features (hence my list 
that you completed & commented).

>Paul, is there going to be any issue with NPDS 3.0 serving up multiple

Why are you talking about files?
And what kind of problems could there be?

I guess you mean something like: "is it possible to make several soup 
requests to send a single resource over HTTP?" the answer is it is 
technically what NPDS already does in some cases (for example when it 
displays the list of notes, it makes a query on the Note soup and 
then iterates on the results to display the list).

>Hello. Let me introduce myself... :)

Do you have some kind of reference? ;)
I think that there are other web designer professional with a NPDS 
server and talented amateurs. I am probably the worst HTML coder on 
this list, that's why I'm looking for talents ;)

The In/Out idea was actually Nicolas Zinovieff's.

Of course. This should be linked with a clear 
Notes-serving/HTML-serving/Templates/Admin-notes-editing/Bulletin-board 
policy.
It is currently quite a mess, so ideas are welcome. Especially 
something allowing us to distinguish between a post and a note from 
the NotePad interface (maybe using the routing button or something, 
ideas are welcome and encouraged).

>Specifically, I guess I'm interested

It fits what I've been thinking about. I don't have any clear 
solution yet, but there is work to be done for sure.

Sounds great, doesn't it?

BTW, I can see two not-too-boring ways to communicate dreams of a 
software. Designing mockups (such as pseudo-static NPDS websites I 
was talking about) and drafting documentation. Both are easy to use 
for the coding process. Of course, we can also draft specifications 
if you prefer it the more-official way.

Let's put it at the bottom of the list after Victor's idea of a RGB & 
HSV sliders ;)

BTW, about SSIs (and it's linked to your request). One of the great 
weaknesses of SSIs I guess is the fact that they can't take 
arguments. No-one uses the "unused" argument in their scripts, don't 
you?
(I also thought of inline NewtonScript directly in page for server-side code).

It's what I call Bulletin Board-feature. I think that we all see the

Sorry about that. I keep forgetting that I need to try to write without

we would do it. In other words, I would assume that we would make all of 
the HTML and CSS valid according to the W3C standards.

Yes, this is what I meant. I guess I shouldn't have used the term 
"files", but instead the term "requests". I was concerned whether or not 
NPDS could actually serve a single web page that consisted of several 
(and possibly dozens) or separate images and other bits from the soup.

Well, I am going to assume that the new NPDS will be more stable and 
robust than the current version. This would make it less necessary to 
have something like NPDS Watcher monitoring the process and restarting 
the Newton when thing go wrong. However, if such a monitor is deemed to 
be a requirement, why can't we build some sort of auto-restart mechanism 
into the NPDS package itself? I'm just asking a question. There may be 
several reason why this is a dumb idea.

I suppose that would be the most logical way of looking at it. Being able

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Towards NPDS 3: themes and structure
From: John Skinner <nospam_john_at_johnskinner_dot_net>

I like the all comments so far and would like to add a few to the
discussion. (sorry if it's long, I got carried away)

Yes I agree on: File uploading/downloading, Bulletin Board style threaded
note posting/reading.

And these...
-----
(1.) LAYOUT: I really like the idea of having some sort of Page templates or
themes.

We could have reference to the different "Themes" in the documentation
(pdf?) with little pictures so one could see/predict the layout (without;
having to change it, browse to it from an external browser and look, and
back and forth).

It seems it would make more sense to have them be CSS so they would be
incorporated into every page that is viewed from the NPDS server. Like on
Grant's page with his navigation bar at the top, or Paul's NPDS server now,
he has the Newton logo .gif file as a background on (I think) every page. It
doesn't have to be CSS, but some similar principle. This would help to give
continuity to the site if it were on every page.

It would be nice to have it done in frames, but then we would be excluding
browsing to it from Newton browsers like NetHopper/Newt's Cape wouldn't we?

If we used frames, we could have it load like a navigation bar into one
frame on first load, then only load following pages in the main window.
Maybe this could be done somehow with CSS though, I don't know. Thoughts?

NOTE: I'm a novice web designer, but I would be willing to make a couple of
simple "Themes"!

-----
(2.) WEBPAGER: I also agree on storing the received pages into somewhere
like the In/Out store.

I also agree with Grant that the interface should be bigger. Maybe full
screen even.

I know that in a older version number of the WebPager, you could reply
directly to a page (from someone that sent it from a Newton running NPDS) by
tapping on the little button that looks like a Newton. The only awkward part
of this was that it had to open NetHopper and download the senders
"WebPager" page from their NPDS server.

I know it seems like a lot, but it would be nice if it could operate similar
to AOL's Instant Messenger or other chat program. Instead of loading the
web page of the sender's "WebPager" in a browser, maybe the reply could be
composed in a new, different frame of the WebPager window. Then it could be
sent directly to the sender's WebPager program. Thoughts?

-----
(3.) REMOTE ADMIN: (To re-enable) The ability to post to any directory, not
just the default "Whiteboard" area.

Right now you can remotely shutdown the NPDS server. It would be nice if you
could also reboot your Newton remotely. Maybe by somehow triggering some
NewtScript to have NPDS Watcher to do it.


(4.) REBOOTING: I think all of us would like to have the option to have all
of NPDS start minimized in the "Star" menu upon reboot.

(Speaking of this; Hey Grant, let me know if you ever get that "CardCloser"
to work on Newton OS 2.x)

Reading what Grant said about having a web-based remote admin system: THIS
IS A LONG SHOT, but it might be possible with a modified Steve Weyer's
NewtVNC! Right now, the two things stopping us are: In the current version
there is no JAVA web-based connection to the server like in the real VNC,
and the server mode only listens for a connection for a handful of seconds.
We could ask Steve if it would be possible to put the JAVA web interface in
a version or as an add-on to WABA. Then (getting longer and longer...) we
could have a link on the current Admin page that would trigger a NewtScript
to tell NewtVNC to listen for a connection. I realize after writing this
that this will be on the bottom of the list, ha ha.


P.S. I got my best geek friend Newtonized and the two of us are learning
NewtonScript to help the Newton Community!

On any server. In a nutshell, let's dream folks ;)

Probably. But a new interface would definitely make easy to implement 
the domain SSI for Paul Filmer.

Indeed, we need a watcher, especially considering that other things 
could bring the server down. I am not sure it has to be specifically 
included into the server, although it's not really a module but 
rather a function.

Actually, I'm not very fond of frames as they're (a) not supported by 
many browsers including NetHopper/Newt's Cape and (b) apparently 
dropped with HTML 4.0.

>Maybe this could be done somehow with CSS though, I don't know.

This and many other things can be done with CSS.
I'm just an amateur HTML coder and more interested in the languages 
than the visual aspects of things, but as I see it, CSS is a way to 
have the thing look nice under modern browsers (supporting CSS, 
basically) and keep the thing readable in Lynx/NetHopper/Newt's Cape 
& Co.

>I also agree with Grant that the interface should be bigger. Maybe full

So should be the script editor (it's a pain when you try to write 
cgis during university naps on databases).

You can still do it. What it opens depends on which browser are 
installed, but I agree that there should be an included way to answer 
as you describe it.

Excellent. This makes the develop of themes extremely flexible. Not that 
I would encourage overdoing the design of a theme just for the sake of 
the design. We will still need to consider the file size of the various 
components that make up a theme. The less bloated we get, the better.

Erm. Yes. I am. I guess I was being a bit too indirect. In fact it was a 
reference to my ability to create web -based designs. Sign me up!

I understand now. This method certainly makes it easier to prototype 
ideas.

Let me see if I understand this. We would be getting rid of the concept 
of the script editor to create custom SSI tags, by replacing it with the 
ability to have NPDS parse and execute the NS code directly from the HTML 
(or noteserved pages). Is this correct?

Now I've got it. I guess I was just curious to see if their were any 
benefits or efficiencies to combined the Watcher with another component 
of NPDS.

I'll try to explain better Paul.

JAVA...      The regular VNC software that you get for Windows, Mac, 
Linux and other OSs has a JAVA web browser interface incorporated into 
it, allowing one to access the VNC server from a standard JAVA enabled 
web browser. Otherwise, the only way to connect to a VNC server is by 
downloading and installing a OS specific VNC client on your computer. 
Right now, the only way to connect to NewtVNC is by using standard VNC 
client software.
In order for NewtVNC to be able to accept incomming connections from a 
WEB BROWSER instead of a VNC client, there would have to be the JAVA 
based web browser interface added to NewtVNC.

Triggering......         The current NewtVNC has a "listen" button to 
start to listen for incomming connections, but it times-out after about 
15 seconds. So, you can't have your NewtVNC in server mode all day 
waiting for connections. I thought that maybe we could incorporate a 
link into a web page served by NPDS, that could somehow make the NewtVNC 
program start to listenfor a connection. Then, when you try to connect 
to it right after clicking this link, you would be within the timeout 
period and be able to connect.

Do any of these ramblings make it more clear, or did I just complicate it?

I've been following this thread closely but haven't had time to reply. 
However, I saw something that made me cringe and had to put in mi dos 
centavos.

I considered and rejected inline newtonscript at one point since not too 
many users of NPDS could write Newtonscript, and in fact, I even had a 
rough extension to Notepad Server that could run arbitrary Newtonscript 
posted from the web, so it can be done. I was considering using it as some 
sort of remote administration  tool. Anyway, if you implement inline 
execution, you need a tight security policy with this. Otherwise, I could 
post a note containing RATHER malicious Newtonscript and your Newton could 
be rendered nearly unusable. The big problem is that everything runs with 
full read-write-execute permissions in the Newtonscript environment. You 
need to be REALLY sure that nothing can slip in from outside to sabotage 
your machine.

All this said, I think it's a great idea, provided it's properly 
implemented. Another thing is that passing variables to server side 
includes CAN be done. I simply was too lazy to write the parser that would 
take the SSI tag, parse out the variable(s), and pass them to the script. 
However, it can be done. The unused variable that's in every NPDS SSI 
function declaration is required by the onboard NS compiler (for some 
arcane reason), but it doesn't have to be unused, it just has to be in the 
function declaration, Actually, if I remember correctly, you can even have 
more than one variable in that declaration, but there has to be at least 
one.

Also, the SSI code can be modified so that it functions outside a page, 
acting more like a CGI. If I remember right, there's a tag in the SSI soup 
for the "name" of the SSI. If someone had time, he could write a wrapper 
that would be able to call the SSI function as an executable, knowing the 
name of the SSI. Thus, you could do things like http://my.npds.com/cgi-bin/
MySpecialScript and return a full dynamically generated page.

I also agree with Paul's assertion that the interface for Script Editor 
needs to be revised. It fits nicely on my old MP130 but not on your fancy 
MP2x00 screens.

Oh man, you guys are making me hanker to get out my old Newt and start 
coding for it again (now that I have a job and a degree)

	I'll chime in here -- despite the beauty of the Watcher
(..beholder?), it still seems to defeat my server, and as soon as I leave,
something crashes it, and it often restarts without establishing a
connection.  So there it sits, thinking it is connected, and since there are
no queries, it never resets again, and I find it the next time I am in the
office in this unconnected, but ever-so-ready to serve state.

	My work-around is a simple Stop-Start cycle (which also sometimes
requires a "Connect" tap), which I would love to be able to do automatically

I certainly understand John's point about making the web pages refresh or 
change faster by minimizing the amount of content reloading by using 
frames. However, this kind of efficiency offered by frames is rather 
misplaced. Since you are actually loading more HTML with a frames based 
interface than than single page design, you end up sending more data to 
the client at any given time. For a design the has a navbar, main content 
area, and perhaps a footer - the client actually has to request four html 
pages including the frameset wrapper in order to display the page. Oof!

To Paul's point, as far as I can determine, the W3C has not dropped 
frames as part of either the current HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 
recommendations.

Is there anything we could do using server push from NPDS (or the pager

This can be done with a simple SSI with NPDS 2.x.

It is currently some NPDS-core frame that is passed as the argument.

Actually, I deduced this from the division in three DTDs, strict,

Date: Wed, 20 Feb 2002 15:54:07 -0700
From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

I discovered a couple of updates to Yoichi Takezawa's UNI branch of the 
NPDS project. First off, his site has moved and the link on the main NPDS 
branch page is 404. The new url is:

     http://homepage.mac.com/yoichy/npdsu.html

And speaking of features to add to NPDS 3.0, some of the things I found 
while digging around on Yoichi's page (and through his source code) were 
mentions of new NotePad Server features called NamesPoster and 
WorksPoster. NamesPoster lets you post new information to the Names 
application (as you can see from the screenshot on the above page) and I 
assume that WorksPoster does the same for NewtonWorks.

Very interesting.

Every so often I get the NPDS Watcher's NS Task dead warning sound, and it
usually results in a reboot.  However, every once in a while, I get the
tones and then no reboot, simply the floater asking me if I want to reboot.
Sometimes I'm here to respond, sometimes I'm not.  Sometimes the server
still works, sometimes not.  Very odd.

Here's a screenshot (which I got via NPDS, which obviously was still

Hmmm. I've never run into this particular situation. What prefs settings 
are you using for the watcher?

OK. First, there is a need for some precisions.
There is no such thing as the NPDS Watcher's NS Task.
There is:
* the NS Task watcher.
* the rest.

The NS Task watcher basically checks that the NewtonScript task is 
alive. It runs as a separated task (using NewtonOS preemptive 
multithreading) and if the NewtonScript task died or isn't responsive 
enough (i.e. it hasn't heard of it for too long), it reboots without 
any confirmation or sound (since the confirmation & sound are 
generated from the NewtonScript task). You can enable or disable it 
independently from the rest.

The rest belongs to NewtonScript task and basically does a series of 
tests including:
- check that there isn't a dialog saying that the server died
- check that a software cannot listen on the port the NPDS server is 
supposed to listen.

The problem you experienced is linked with the latter. The watcher 
succeeded to listen on this port because when a connection arrives, 
NPDS cannot re-listen immediatly (a limitation of NewtonOS TCP/IP 
stack I guess). There is some gap which is huged compared to a TCP/IP 
packet and small compared to NewtonScript. I made some tests by 
calling lynx repeatedly in a bash script, and it's terrific to see 
that the Newton can only handle a very small part of the incoming 
requests.
Anyway, what happened here is that the watcher succeeded in getting 
into this little window, although NPDS was still up. Hence the 
situation. Of course, when we worked on the watcher, I precisely 
remember that we thought this could arrive, but not too often to be 
noticed as this window is rather small. Paul, once again you proved 
me wrong ;)

>Dang that green is ugly on a PC, compared to a Mac...

Umm, can't PCs display pictures in thousands or millions of colors?

Yes, but the gamma of the displays are different between Mac and Windows, 
so even though both machines may be able to display the same number of 
colours, the PC will show the colours using a different default tonal 
range. Essentially, without software-based colour management software, 
PCs display colours more harshly and with more contrast than Macs. At 
least by my opinion.

Oh, I forgot this problem of gamma correction. Maybe we should serve

Hi all,

I've just noticed a bug when iterating thru my system soup. NPDS 
leaves one preferences soup entry per version apparently (at least 
the NotePad server). So for those who have been having weird problems

Is the best solution to this to delete the pHTML:MAVON preferences soup 
using Prefs Cleaner (or similar) and then reset your settings in 
NoteServ? Could this be why my main NoteServ Folder and the Posts Folder 
settings always revert back to another folder when I've installed newer 
versions of the package?

I noticed that it's true for every package. But I haven't analyzed 
further yet (since I no longer go to boring classes, I have less time 
to investigate this kind of problems).

I think that which preferences entry is returned is deterministic. 
But there could be some conflict.

The reason why settings revert back to other folders when you upgrade 
isn't linked with this phenomenon directly. It's a kind of feature of 
the NPDS modules preferences to revert to default if the jump in the 
versions is too big.
I think that the bug is there actually, and I'm probably the guilty 
one because I modified this code to not revert to default settings 
when we do a big jump. At least, it was I meant to do.

Daniel Claessens left me note on my NPDS server that he has started up 
another iteration of the tracker. The web page says it's running on a Mac 
too. And it looks like the sharing code runs three ways. That's a good 
thing, right?

Actually, AFAIK he's only pulling down shared entries from my server, not
shakti as well.  So the network is something like:

shakti <--> misato --> mymacs

Note the directionality of the arrows.  I'm not sure where physically his
server is, but it seems to be routed through Kansas City...

Actually, My location is Nebraska. The route you get when you do a trace
route is dependant on your location and internet traffic.

Also, the sharing is going something like this:
shakti <--> misato --> mymacs or
misato <--> shakti --> mymacs

I have verified this by turning sharing off to misato, then to shakti
turning sharing back on to misato. And I still get updated.
Also I have found that I only receive info from misato and shakti for
Newtons logged directly to them.

For if I share only with shakti I get only a few certain newtons
and if I share only with misato I get only a few certain newtons.
Nut if I share with both of them I get all the newtons displayed on both
shakti and misato.

Also, as far as I know the only way the sharing will be like this
shakti <--> misato <--> mymacs
is if misato and shakti add mymacs to their SLIST.

Yeah.  I think I wrote it that way because that's the easiest way to
ensure that duplicates aren't retrieved.  I've added mymacs to the misato
tracker's share list in the INI file.

Why does Mymacs.net tracker restart? It's the second time I notice 
it, and this time it doesn't seem to ask shakti and misato about 
which Newton server it knows.
<troll>Could the reason be that it is powered by this wonderful thing 
known as MacOS X?</troll>

Seriously, you need to set the .ini file properly so both 
shareEnabled and share lists are set properly.
On shakti, I have:

shareEnabled = true
shareServer = misato.chuma.org 2110
shareServer = www.mymacs.net 2110

(there was a bug for shareEnabled line parsing, I don't recall what 
are the acceptable values now, but true should work, but anyway, 
shareEnabled is just to say that your tracker will tell the others 
which Newtons it knows).
So the last time shakti was rebooted (the tape drive used for 
backups, including NewtonTalk mailing list's, wasn't plugged), the 
tracker was restarted (it's in rc.d) and it was asking misato (I have 
added mymacs.net since).

BTW, AFAIK, not a single line of NPDS Tracker was written on the US 
soil. However, part of the coding have been done on a mac running 
MacOS 9.1 ;)

I dunno, but misato's running on a very hacked-up version of RedHat 6.0,
we could argue for months which one sucked more...

There was no bug: I just forgot to specify what port in the ini file,
which was causing an error on server start.  That's the correct format
above.  I already setup misato like this and restarted it a few days ago.

I apologize for restarting the Mymacs.net server often. I have been 
playing around with the java code. I went back to the original code and 
recompiled.

I will now do all my tinkering on test machines.
sorry for the inconvenience.

Hey, don't take it this way, it was merely a joke on my side. I was 
just wondering why it was restarted that often.
And please share your improvements to the tracker server! :)

Subject: [NPDS] Re: Fw: Re: Another Tracker

I have only made minor improvements so far as I only know a little C and 
no java.

Change 1:

I changed the following line: Vector theHosts = new Vector( 
mHostInfoVector );
to:   Vector theHosts = new Vector();
        theHosts = mHostInfoVector;

I did this so my compiler would compile it for JAVA 1.1.8

It also allows it to run fully under JAVA 1.1.8

Change 2:

I changed the following lines that are similar to this: else if 
(commandline.equals("VTEST"))
to: else if (commandline.equals("VTEST") || commandline.equals("vtest"))

This allows me to type lowercase commands in the admin tool.

Also I added explanations as to what certain commands were looking for: 
out.print("Add or Delete record?[a/d]: ");

Change 3:

I changed the following line: String tableStr = "<table border=\"1\" 
width=\"100%\" summary=\"List of online Newtons\">\r\n<tr><th 
width=\"10%\">Active</th><th width=\"75%\">Server Name</th><th>Last 
Verified</th></tr>\r\n";

to: String tableStr = "<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\" summary=\"List 
of online Newtons\">\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#9999ff\"><th 
width=\"10%\">Active</th><th width=\"75%\">Server Name</th><th>Last 
Verified</th></tr>\r\n";

This adds a background color to the table.

I would like to add the following but i am as of yet not knowledgeable 
enough to do it.

1) The ability to restart the server remotely.
2) A setting in the .ini file to do a verification on server startup.
3) A gui interface that can be run to Administer the server from the 
host computer.

I don't think Java can reload itself... maybe you could have it fork off a
shell script that kills Java and then reloads it...

That's easy, I can add that.

Hrm... also doable, but I don't have time for such an undertaking right
now.  Maybe in May when I'm out of school.

Er. This might lead to problems. Well, this will lead to problems.

Umm, it used to compile under Java 1.1.8 (I used CW), but I no longer 
tried because there is a bug in this version of the VM and it causes 
troubles in NPDS tracker. It's about DNS cache.
So if anyone uses a domain name, please don't use mymacs.net tracker.
NPDS Tracker indeed requires Java 1.2 or higher.

>I changed the following lines that are similar to this: else if

I'd suggest capitalizing the input and then comparing it to VTEST for 
efficiency.

Great. It's true that one doesn't guess what to type there.

>This adds a background color to the table.

I think we should have a style sheet approach so that the color could 
be set in the template.html file.

Cf Victor's answer.

Isn't xterm a GUI? ;)
Victor, if you work on that, please keep the option of having the 
tracker faceless, as shakti doesn't run any X server.

I thought the workaround thing worked for 1.1.8, or did we realize that it
doesn't?

Yes.

Yes yes yes.  An embedded style sheet should be in the included

I was actually thinking of an applet that the server can serve up so it
will run in a browser, and it can just connect back to the server and talk
to the existing ADMIN interface.

AFAIR, the work around was introduced with 1.2.

Wow. Maybe the thing could be set to use some IP instead of simply 
127.0.0.1 and be used remotely? ;)

I thought it was 1.1.8.  Or maybe it was 1.2, which is why I had to
upgrade Java on misato.

Well, yeah, of course.  It would be the exact same way that VNC servers
serve up the Java version of the client.

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce NPDS Tracker Server 0.1.29.
You can download it here:
http://npds.free.fr/%20Tracker%20Server/NPDSTracker-0.1.29/

What's new:

* Fixed the bug in processing of console commands, so now lowercase 
commands work.
* The console now says "server validation test started" before it 
finishes the validation.
* The tracker was waiting forever for an answer from fellow trackers, 
which was bad.
* Added style information to colorize the table.
* The server performs a verification on startup.
* Vector copy constructor is no longer called, so this should compile 
on Java < 1.2 (but it will have problems because of bugs in the JVM)
* The server now checks the hosts passed as REGUP parameters to be 
correct (to resolve and to be not private).

Enjoy.

Paul

MyMacs.net is back up!

I appologize for the inconveineance. I moved from my little apartment into a
house. I had tried to orchestrat it so there would only be a short outage.
My ISP told me my connection was done. Well it was for the most part. They
negelcted to tell my that My old dsl conection was CAP and my new connection
was DMT.

This required that the nvram on my router to be flash upgraded and
reconfigured.

Mymacs is now up permanently.

Thank You!..... Dan..... :-)

Paul would it be possible (without a lot of work) to modify the time

If so, is this something I could do, having downloaded the source?

P.S. I was looking at the "Install & Remove" file, and I think I see 
where to change the value although I could be wrong.

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to say that although I think it's greate that folk are still
working on NPDS the old version (at lightYear media) used to work fine. The
latest one crashes regularly causing my Newt to reboot etc. and sometimes
requiring me to reboot manually.

Alos, When serving GIF images I used to be able to run a program (on the
Newt) to set the colours of the reulting GIF. I can't see how to do that
anymore?

In main layout, AutoLaunch method, change 5000:
  AddDelayedSend(app, 'LaunchWebServer, nil, 5000);
to whatever value you want in milliseconds.

Indeed it's not in Install & Remove :)

This is the big drawback of the Watcher. It restarts the Newton :)

You haven't installed Victor's RGB & HSV module? ;)

This slider thing is much more complex with the new code because we 
now have 16 grays instead of two colors. Now, if you define something 
simple to implement, I might take the time to do it.

Hi all,

I've uploaded a highly experimental new version of NPDS Watcher.
What happens is that it no longer reboots the Newton (although it 
still says here and there "reboot"), but instead, it shuts down the 
server, waits for 30 seconds (for tracker client to finish and so 
on), disconnect the Internet link violently, waits for 5 seconds and 
then restarts the server.

Additionally (special for John) it minimizes the server.

I also set the NS Task check time to 10 minutes.

Note that:
+ the watcher will still reboot your Newton (without any warning) if 
the NewtonScript task doesn't seem to be living for 40 minutes 
(unless the NS Task Check task itself died, sorry, I can't do 
anything in that case)
+ the internet connection is closed now matter which internet 
application was open. Consider it better than rebooting the Newton.

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] nHTTPd 2.043, Watcher 012ac

Hi all,

I've just uploaded nHTTPd 2.043 & Watcher 012ac to NPDS Development 
Updates website (http://npds.free.fr)

What's new?
-----------
nHTTPd:
* Fixed the ListenCB -60049 bug.
* We no longer can be star'd twice.

Watcher:
* nHTTPd is properly maximized before being launched.

Who should upgrade?
-------------------

* Every nHTTPd 2.042 user should upgrade if I don't see any obvious 
bug I left in the next days.
* Thrill seekers who upgraded to Watcher 011ac would probably prefer 
this new build as it fixes the double nHTTPd in the star menu.

Watcher 012ac requires nHTTPd 2.043, but nHTTPd 2.043 doesn't require 
Watcher 012ac.

Note:
-----
The -60049 bug is one of the bugs that make nHTTPd no longer listen 
for incoming requests after some event.

The cause was that the new endpoint was instantiated just before 
calling Accept, and under some timings, this would mean trying to 
listen before the previously listening endpoint was actually 
connected (it is exactly what -60049 means, can't listen because some 
other endpoint is currently listening).
I have just reverted the two asynchronous calls, and consequently, it 
is still possible that the -60049 error pops out again, although this 
is less probable.

If ever you experience this error with this new build (a dialog says: 
"ListenCB error -60049 or something like this), please drop me a 
line, and I will instantiate the new endpoint only after the accept 
call is finished. I haven't done so because incoming requests 
arriving between the moment the connection is accepted and the moment 
the new endpoint goes listening again are lost. The shortest we can 
keep this gap, the more responsive the Newton is.

Subject: [NPDS] After using WaveLAN drivers and NPDS, no connection slip

I have been using the WaveLAN drivers for quite some time now. First I used
the original beta drivers from Hiroshi (before the Alpha versions). Now I
have all of the drivers installed, but all are frozen except Alpha 3.

Everything has been working great, then one day my Newton stopped displaying
the connection slip when nHTTPd launches! You start nHTPPd and it just
connects.

I checked all the settings, (soft) reset the Newton, left it off for several
hours. Nothing seems to work. Then my other Newton did the same thing. I
erased all soups for Internet Settings and Worksite preferences, still no
change.

I wonder if the WaveLAN drivers are causing some kinds corruption of some
kind?


Any thoughts from the peanut gallery?

I think it's a bug with the watcher, dunno when it appeared.
Tap nHTTPd, then [i]->Prefs->Admin->Show NIE Connect Slip

I'm an idiot! I checked my settings and sure enough, NPDS setup was set 
not to show connection slips! Thanks Paul!

About the violent thing,... I had a mission, I wanted to get rid of the 
problem and it was on my test Newton. So I have the freedom to do what 
ever on it without fear of much loss. Kinda fun too!

Has anyone else noticed a problem where NPDS will just stop serving using 
the latest versions of the server and the watcher. I'm just wondering if 
Watcher attempting to restart the server process rather than rebooting 
the Newton could cause NPDS to become disabled. I'm not getting any error 
messages, just that NPDS seems to be sitting there doing nothing.

I'm not by my Newt right now (I'm at work and the Newt is at home), so I 
can't elaborate. But I'll try to get some more details when I'm in front 
of the device.

I think this is how the problem starts...

I glanced at my Newton and noticed that it had a "Closing open 
connections" dialog box on the screen, as shown in the screen dump linked 
below. nHTTPd is still running (since I was still able to take the screen 
dump), but it doesn't seem that Watcher is active anymore. Note the pop 
up menu from the blinking star. Weird. I believe that if NPDS goes 
kerflunky at this point, and Watcher is no longer running, that's when 
the whole server stops working. The Newton doesn't freeze, but NPDS can 
not longer be restarted since Watcher isn't active.

     http://www.splorp.com/junk/screenconnections020418.gif

I may just go back to using Watcher 010ac for the time being.

OK, let me first describe what is happening, then tell
you about the Newt.
For the last 3 days now, I have been coming home to a
frozen NPDS server. No power. Nada! I hit the power
switch and nothing. I pop out the batteries and unplug
the AC, pop in the batteries? Nothing. The only way I
can get the Newt back is to take all the power out,
put the batteries back in, hit the reset while turning
on the Newt and saying "no" to erasing all my data.
Once this happens, I can plug in the AC and the Newt
will hum along for another day.

This Newt is an acellerated MP2100 to 119Mhz (custom
crystal job...see:http://newton.tek-ed.com/newtspeed
for details)
I am running NPDS server V2.042 and NPDS watcher
V1.0a10.
I also have a dLink de-660 card and some OEM'ed 4mb
card. 
When the Newt dies, it dies hard and will not come
back without a full reset...I don't know what is
happening...anyone have some ideas to look for?

How can an upgraded 2100 run at 119Mhz when a stock 2100 runs at 162Mhz?

Dear Gant,

I am having the same problem from time to time. I have to reset the device manually. I've got NPDS Watcher 012ac and nHTTPd 2.043 running on the internal store. I am not able to locate the problem. The day before yestaday the server worked perfecty. Yesterday I had the same problem you discribed. I tried a complete new installation after both a wipe with the wipe-utility and a Brainwipe. All with the same unstable result. I suspect the tracker chient. I've got the impression, when it is disabled, the system is much more stable.

Well you see...if you slow the CPU down, then the
electrons move slower and they're not as tired when
they get to where they are going and as such can do
more work. So, even though the Newt is running
"slower" it is actually faster because the electrons
are working harder :-P
Actually...I fat-fingered that (late night typing
should be out-lawed) and it should have read "219Mhz"

When I changed back to using the 010ac version of the Watcher, the 
stability issues went away. it must have something to do with how the 
012ac version tried to restart the NPDS process. Occasionally things just 
get hung up and the whole thing goes all cattywumpus.  However, the 
latest version of the NPDS core seems to rock!

Yes I do. After switching back to 010ac, my server has been running all 
weekend without a freeze or reboot. I haven't heard from Paul about why 
012ac might be causing the connection problems, and I'd like to see if we 
can provide him with some more information about the problem. I certainly 
prefer a solution where the NPDS server is restarted after a problem 
rather than having the whole Newton restarted.

>When will we get our hands on the new version of NPDS?

That's up to Paul at this point. I know he was starting to make plans 
regarding 3.0, but he has been rather busy. I'll let him provide an 
answer to that question in his own time.

From: Ed Kummel <nospam_tech_ed_at_yahoo_dot_com>
Subject: [NPDS] Re: DNS

Well...first you need to buy a domain name.
Then you need to register that domain name with a
domain server.
Then your NPDS server needs to have a static IP (yes,
I know that there are dynamic IP solutions, but I have
found that they are impractical)
Then you need to point that IP to your domain.
And there you have it!

Now, if you aren't familiar with DNS servers, I would
suggest you let a professional set it up. DNS can be
confusing and it goes way beyond the scope of this
list!
If you are familiar with DNS, I would suggest that you
follow more or less this chain.

First, go to Granitecanyon.com and get the name
servers you will be using.

Second, go to godaddy.com and register your domain (if
you already have your domain registered, you can skip
this step)

Third, enter name servers you got from Granite Canyon
into your domain registration.

Go back to Granite Canyon and setup your domain with
the static IP that your NPDS is assigned to.

Be careful. If you haven't done this before, it is not
something a neophite should attempt. If you have
problems, get and read the O'Reilly book, DNS & BIND.
(actually, only the first 4 chapters are needed for
what you are doing)

Viola! you're now registered!

The alternate method is to contact your ISP, Purchase
a static IP and have them set up the DNS for your
domain...{whimp! ;-P}

Hi folks,

I realized that NPDS Tracker 0.1.29 didn't filter out 192.168.x.x

0.1.30 fixes it.

From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

What does everyone think about changing the default "NewtonOS Personal 
Data Sharing" link that appears in the footer of every served note, so it 
points to the NPDS development page instead of the old NPDS pages. As 
much as I want to credit Matt for his work on NPDS, I think it's 
confusing for any curious user or visitor to our Newton-served pages to 
have to follow the current trail of pages to get to the main inforamtion 
regarding NPDS. For example:

The link currently points to:

     http://come.to/lightyear_media

Which redirects to:

     http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearDesign/

But is still a couple of clicks away from Matt's main NPDS page:

     http://homepage.mac.com/LightyearDesign/NPDS/

I suggest that we take a shortcut and simply change the built-in NoteServ 
URL to point to http://npds.free.fr/ - which actually does reference 
Matt's pages quite a few times anyway.

Thoughts?

Perhaps even a user defined footnote would be good.  

I'm quite happy to give Matt and all the others who have contributed to the
various pieces of NPDS credit for the work they have done -- I did also pay
for NPDS, so perhaps I can ask to be able to alter the footnote (yes, yes, I
know I can go into the code and do it myself by recompiling).

Actually, you don't even need to pay^W modify the code, because 
scripts take precedence over built-in SSIs. I've been using this 
trick for HOME for a while now, and I have just did the same for 
CREDITS. Thanks for the idea, Grant :)

For those who aren't scripts experts like Paul (cf 
http://128.150.4.33/html/-88186101$71.nsd for his impressive 
collection), just open the Script editor, tap the new button (a note 
with little lines all around), tap Untitled, put something like "New 
Credits" for the name, CREDITS for the SSI, check activated and 
static value (unless you make some special script), then close the 
slip (not very easy). Below // Script Template put something like:
"<p><code>Served By: <a href=\"http://npds.free.fr\">NewtonOS 
Personal Data Sharing</a> 3.0a1</code></p>"

(escape all the " with a backslash)

The version string is built-in, and there is no very simple way to retrieve it.

However, there is a way. The idea is to retrieve the version from the 
NoteServ prefs.
Uncheck the static box, and do:

"<p><code>Served By: <a href=\"http://npds.free.fr\">NewtonOS 
Personal Data Sharing</a> " & GetAppPrefs( '|pHTML:MAVON|, nil ) & 
"</code></p>"

Please note that this is untested, not particularly clean, it might 
not return the correct version, and this method to retrieve the 
version like this will very probably go away.

In a nutshell, hardcode the version number :)

BTW, Paul, just had a look at your clean up script.
I think that the problem is that kAppSymbol is a constant only 
defined withing NTK (like kAppName) and on your Newton, it is an 
unknown global variable (I don't have any NewtonOS documentation 
here, but I bet it is the exception you get when you tap evaluate in 
the script editor).

What you probably want is something like:

func()
begin
   // Remove every cache entry, whoever created it.

   // *The* soup.
   local cacheS := GetUnionSoup("NPDS:MAVON");

   // Check that the soup exists (we never know).
   if (cacheS = nil) then return "The cache soup didn't exist.";

   // Let's count the number of entries removed.
   local int nbEntries := 0;
   local cacheQ := cacheS:query(nil);
   local theEntry := cacheQ:entry();
   while( theEntry ) do
   begin
     // Let's actually remove it.
     EntryRemoveFromSoupXmit( theEntry, '|Cache cleanup script:NPDS| );
     // Au suivant!
     theEntry := cacheQ:next();
     nbEntries := nbEntries + 1; // Counting help you sleep.
   end;
   return nbEntries && "entry(ies) were removed.";
end; // Bill Posters is innocent.

joined the ranks by setting up my spare (another 2100) for daily use.

The server machine will in fact remain my development machine because 
it has the SER Board. Additionally, it will sit next to the keyboard 
for a while now and be used as a battery charging station until I put 
my hands on a US to Europe power plug adapter to use my new Power 
Adapter.

What kind of synchronization methods are you using, fellow 
dedicated-Newton serving users?

I haven't decided yet what to put on which Newton, but I like the 
idea of serving birthdays via Avi's BD and consequently, I'd like to 
have at least my Names DB mirrored.

Do you have any suggestion?

Paul

>What kind of synchronization methods are you using, fellow

I suppose the simplest way is to make sure the newtons have the same 
owner name and then use NCU  to load the names backup from our 
mobile/master newtons in to our server newtons on a regular basis. Of 
course this assumes that we don't want to enter that kind of data 
into our server newtons in the first place. If we want to put 
names/dates/notes into both newtons i suppose claris organiser 
synching is the only convenient route. can claris organiser synch 
with 2 newtons?

To be honest, I can't get NPDS stable enough to really make this 
worthwhile. NPDS watcher seems to completely confuse my mp and cause 
a lot of errors. Without it NPDS only seems to run for a few hours. I 
might try a hard reset to see if I can improve things, but I am 
really looking forward to a more solid version.

I don't know NewtonScript at all but I am very proficient at 
Javascript. How hard do you think it would be for me to get into 
NewtonScript programming? Are resources for this available on the 
net? What is the best development environment?

Thanks for all you are doing for us Newtoneers. You are very appreciated.

Regards

Richard Braine

I've gotta agree with Richard.  Or you could maintain one master Newt and beam
Names over to the server.  With a little NS this could be automated nicely.
I'm not sure how the Newton would handle duplicate names though... if it would
overwrite them or make multiples.

If you've got a lot of stuff loaded, it can cause problems generally with
your Newt.  I think I'm gonna be looking at a brain wipe and reload pretty 
soon (and now I have a real, working Mac with NCU so I can make Ethernet
backups!)

Everything is there.  The Development section of the FAQ has tons of 
resources:

http://www.chuma.org/newton/faq/newton-faq-development.html

But for a quick overview:

Programming NewtonScript can be done either on the desktop (with Apple's NTK)
or on the Newton (with Steve Weyer's NewtDevEnv).  

There is also NSBasic, which uses a BASIC (not Visual Basic, but BASIC) 
style syntax.  Has extentions for Internet access and a GUI form designer.

There is *also* Waba for the Newton.  Waba is a portable Virtual Machine-based
language for Palm, WinCE, Newton, and other platforms.  You use a Java 
compiler on the desktop for development.  If you already know Java or C, and
don't need stable network sockets, serial support, or fast graphics drawing 
(since the Newton version is still lacking in these areas) then I would highly
recommend it.

Well, isn't that a slick way of doing it. Thank you very much for the 
mini-tutorial Paul. There were two things I just learned from this 
information: 1) That scripts take precedence over built-in SSI (this 
doesn't seem to be mentioned in the NPDS documentation, and; 2) I didn't 
realize that there even was a <CREDITS> tag in addition to the <HOME> 
tag, since <CREDITS> isn't listed in the SSI portion of the documentation 
either.

Are there any other undocumented tags that we should be aware of?

I found that the latest version of Watcher (012ac) actually caused my 
Newton to stop serving pages more often than a previous version (010ac). 
Although in principal, the newer version has a much better way of 
attempting to keep thing running (restarting the server process instead 
of forcibly rebooting the Newton), I found that NPDS didn't stay active 
nearly as consistently.

If you are using Watcher 012ac, I suggest you go back to using 010ac and 
see if the server stays up longer, or at least keeps running after a 
reboot.

Oh, I guess that's the SSI documentation you're referring to.

Isn't this tag spit out when you save the "default" home page to Notes?

And of course, you can always sift through the source and play a rousing game
of "find the SSIs".

Indeed. Actually, I should admit I have just tried for HOME and since 
it worked, I deduced that it should be so.

Here is the full list of nHTTPd (the core). Each module can define 
its own SSIs.
Please be aware that documented or not, these tags may go away in 
their current form (the whole tag processing feature will be 
optimized).

Static:
<MOTD>
<DEF_FONT>
<DEF_SIZE>
<CSS_SIZE>
<DEF_COLR>
<HI_COLR>
<HOME>
<CREDITS>
<EMAIL>
<USR_NAME>
<USR_ADDR>
<USR_POST>
<USR_TELE>
<USR_CITY>
<USR_REGION>

Yeah, I didn't mention that my spare doesn't have an ethernet card. 
My idea was to find something fast and reliable.
I've thought about a Dock protocol server or a proxy.
I'll see.

I'll add:
NPDS has been written in NewtonScript on NTK for MacOS.
NPDS 3 has some parts written in C++, though.

Indeed it is. Most of the tags are listed here, but the <CREDITS> one is 
notably missing.

And then Paul Guyot chimed in thusly:

Nevertheless, thanks for the list.

"Will be optimized...", eh? You realize that I must ask the next 
question... When *are* we going to be able to get a peek of "the next 
version" of NPDS? I'm still volunteering my services to help write the

The way I do it is that I backup the stores onto a

that is where NPDS puts the responses in. I tried to
do the "beaming" thing, but found that I could not

instead, once a week (or there abouts) I just do a

couldn't you keep the NPDS notes on one card, and restore the master 
newton's notes to the server's internal storage? You would need to 
make sure that all of the master newtons's notes were on internal 
before making the backup. IIRC the card backup facility only backs up 
data from internal. hang on let me think this through:

1) set master newton to store all notes internally
2) on server machine store NPDS notes on card
3) back up master newton notes from internal to card
4) restore card backup to servers internal - NPDS notes on card 
should be unaffected

if you try this, let me know if it works

I agree. does anybody recommend a Newton environment for writing HTML

but, annoyingly, Newton puts spaces in between all tags which I don't 
like. I was surprised to see that browsers don't accept tags written

I don't remember the name of it, but there was a Newton HTML authoring

his package with NPDS (and vice-versa). Search around and you'll find it. 
Oh, wait.. I think it was called nHTML, but don't quote me on that.

I also am working on a customzied version of nHTML which lets you specify 
uppercase or lowercase tags, and fully quoted attributes.

I use a program called "Picky".
This puts a little diamond at the top of the Newt and
gives you a drop-down of lists that you can pick the
word or combination of text you wish. I have things
like "commands", "days", "events", "HTML"...and so
on...
The about for this is Picky 1.1 1994 S. Millman
(stephenM35@aol.com) It's listed as freeware, so you
might have some luck at UNNA.

Subject: [NPDS] weird error when starting NPDS

OK. Here is what I did. In an effort to test a synch
capability, I made a backup of my main Newt's internal
stores on a card. I then restored it to my NPDS
server. All NPDS stuff (applications and notes) are on
a seperate card. When I restored my newt, all my
notes, names and dates were updated on my NPDS server.
Now, whenever I startup the NPDS server, I get this
error:
"Server: InetGrabLink Internet Error -61001"

then I get a bunch of -48XXX -8XXX and -61xxx errors
(about 4-5 seperate dialog boxes popup with errors)
and the NPDS will not start. If I restart the Newt,
start the Watcher, THEN start NPDS, the server will
start. But! If the Watcher initiates a reboot, the
Newt will vicious cycle through reboot, startup
watcher, reboot, startup watcher, reboot...you get the
picture...
So! What happened? I downloaded a new copy of NPDS
just to make sure that that wasn't the problem. I am
running NPDS 2.042

I have been experiencing this for over a week. Exactly as you

inetgrablink error 61001 which means that when (not if) NPDS crashes 
it never comes up again, even with watcher. this is REALLY getting me 
down.

Well...I did this. I backed everything up on a card. I
made sure that my NPDS stuff was on the card in my
server. Then I restored to the NPDS server all the
stuff I backed up from my main Newton. 
The only problem is that any folder I had on my NPDS
newton but not on my main Newt disappeared. The data
was still there, just no folder. This was fixed by
creating a folder of the same name and automagically
everything that was in the folder previously appeared
in that new folder.
Now, if I can only find out what that inetgrablink
error is all about...

What makes this even weirder is that if I pop my card
with all the NPDS stuff on it (applications and files)
into my other (main) newt, NPDS fires up just fine! I
suspect that perhaps on my NPDS Newt, there is a
package that when it transferred over is no longer
frozen and causing a problem...This will take quite a
bit of time to determine the cause so I don't expect
to find an answer before the end of next week. Becuase
of this, my NPDS server will be down...after over
6,000 hits!

Did you have your ethernet/wireless card in each? I have tried to

OK Ed - I think I have fixed this cos my server stayed up all night 
for the first time in a week...

I followed the instructions on how to use the NPDS Wiper to erase all 
preferences and problems haven't occurred since. To be fair the Wiper 
blurb explains all this to some extent. Wiper blurb is at

I am not sure if you have to save the css but notes remained fine.

Syncing up source code is a good thing. And someday I may actually

It looks like the tracker might have been one of the things making 
npds unstable on my 2100. Having frozen the tracker software, I am no 
longer listed but my 2100 is staying up. Is there a way for the 
tracker to hit my 2100 and verify that it is running at its fixed 
address (62.49.99.226:1993) even though it is not running the tracker 
module. It seems a shame not to list it now that it is a bit more 
reliable. Could the tracker continue to test addresses that regularly 
subscribe until they are consistently not found for a few days? That 
way we could subscribe an address and there would be no requirement 
for that machine to run extra modules, i.e. if it's up, it's up.

Actually, the GIF server will serve the screen with any URL of the form:
/screen/<foo>

It is possible that NPDS core doesn't like query strings there.

Now, normally, clients should reload the resource and NPDS will 
always say it changed. Of course, you can have some stupid proxy in 
the between.

Tracker servers know that Newtons are up by accessing 
/traq/confirm.ns or something like this. If the tracker client is 
inactive, then NPDS will generate a 404.

However, I don't think the problem is the tracker client. I think 
rather that it is repetitive requests of the tracker server plus 
requests at the same time from visitors that make NPDS unstable. Put 
NPDS on, unplug the ethernet cable and NPDS will be *very* stable :)

The good news is that apparently, from C++, one can set an endpoint 
to listen and when an incoming request arrives, tell another endpoint 
to work on it while the first one is still listening. This might 
sound like chinese, but it will mean that no incoming request will be 
lost, unlike what we have now.

I was going to ask why you couldn't just check /index.html but I 
suppose that would be intrusive. But couldn't I tell the tracker 
server that I want to be tracked regardless of whether I am running 
traq? I suppose that would need some kind of authentication.

I am pretty ignorant about these things, but is that roughly 
analogous to apache spawning a new thread for each new HTTP 
connection (or rather, maintaining a few spare threads so that there 
is always one ready for incoming requests)?

thanks Paul. That has fixed my problem. I have a page which displays 
the screen in the middle. I wrote a little javascript in the body 
onload to change the img src name to '/screen/'+(new Date) so that 
browsers always load a new screenshot even if it's stored in cache.

That's exactly the URL it hits.  It should return just 202 NPDS OK or
something like that.  It's in the spec.

Because when Matt wrote it, that's what it did, so we stuck with it :)  It
uses its own URL so that it doesn't skew the logs for other pages, I
suppose.

Well, the confirmation process is made in such a way that you cannot 
try to convince the tracker server that you're up when you're not.
We don't really want to change this because if a server says UP the 
newton should be available (at least, should have been up at last 
verification).

Someone once figured out how to use Apache to fake confirmation 
pages. For weeks his Newton was listed as up and in fact wasn't at 
all. This is frustrating for visitors, isn't it?

AFAIK, Apache 2.x does this but 1.x spawns a new thread.
No, this isn't the same thing. When an incoming request arrives, if 
there is an endpoint listening on that port, it is sent an event 
saying that an incoming request arrived (NewtonOS architecture is 
based on XTI, like OpenTransport, btw). The normal operation then is 
to accept the incoming request. But until another endpoint is set to 
listen, incoming requests are told that the machine isn't listening.

On NPDS 2.0, there was a single endpoint. This endpoing was 
listening, then a request arrived, it processed it, waited for the 
delay you can still set in the prefs, then torn down the link and 
re-listen after a while. So your Newton wasn't responsive for a long 
time. It was common to see Newtons marked as down on Matt's tracker 
(there was no such thing like Victor's tracker) just because they 
were serving a page when the tracker came and knocked in.

On NPDS 2.x <= 2.43, there are multiple endpoints. An endpoint is 
listening, then a request arrives, another endpoint created and set 
to listen while the first one is told to accept the request. These 
two operations are asynchronous, so sometimes the endpoint told to 
listen fails to listen because the other one didn't accept the call 
yet. (you cannot have more than one endpoint listening).

On NPDS 2.44, the second endpoint is set to listen only when the 
first one accepted the call. This makes a larger margin, and it's not 
technically more stable than 2.43.

On NPDS 3, endpoints are native and there is one listening and many 
exchanging data (this isn't possible with NewtonScript endpoints). 
The Newton shall not lose any incoming requests, unless a limit of 
connections is set.

I used a custom verification protocol so that:

1) I was sure that only a small amount of data was transmitted back to the 
tracker server, as opposed to up to 4 kB for a regular note such as 
someone's index.html page. Remember, NPDS was written to be efficient on a 
MP130 and eMate-class machine and such things were important 
considerations.

2) You couldn't just point the tracker at a random web server and stay 
registered. I wanted NPDS servers only on the trackers. Hence, the 202 
HTTP response code. I figured if you were going to spoof our trackers, you 
ought to have to work a little for it.

Also, I intended to eventually include data in the confirm.ns file that is 
returned by the client, allowing dynamic updating of the server's comment 
field or any other thing we might want to transmit to the tracker. But, as 
usual, I didn't get around to it so confirm.ns just contains a little 
blurb of text.

I did this for a while for testing though.  I think you can still go to
http://www.chuma.org/traq/confirm.ns :)

Actually.... that would be a great way of extending the tracker the way
we've been talking about for a while... to have it get the location of the
Newton and display it on a map.

Definitely, this would allow to update the location of the Newton, 
although it's not really likely to change while serving :)
I didn't think about using confirm.ns.

Here's what I would do..

1) Make the tracker sign-on extensible so you could send such things as 
temperature, location, etc. Send the sign-on data in some standard format,
  XML, perhaps. Now, rework the code that generates confirm.ns to call the 
same routine used to generate the sign-on ticket. Voila!

2) Re-work your server to accept the updated format and add a handler for 
the extended data. Then, you can do what you wish with it. If Paul wants 
to write a map handler module and Victor wants to write a little 
thermometer module for reading the Newt's temperature, you can both use 
the same data coming from the NPDS servers.

OK, I've just figured out what was happening here.
There is a bug introduced in some new version of the watcher (the one 
that doesn't reboot the Newton all the time). The Show NIE connect 
slip prefs is disabled. So when you tap the start button, it tries to 
connect to the internet with the default setting. And I guess that 
the default setting isn't mapped with your card.

Go to the prefs, choose Show NIE connect slip, tap the start button, 
select the proper configuration & card, then tap connect and it 
should make it.

Optionally revert to an older version of the watcher. I can read on 
the website that currently supported version of the watcher is 008ac. 
It means what it says :)

(should we update to 010ac?)

I certainly haven't had any complaints or noticed any issues with 010ac - 
other than the very odd version numbering scheme, which seems to afflict 
all watchers. :)

Not if the tracker checks only the submitted address. I mean, the 
tracker server only need test the submitted ip number/address to see 
if it serves index.html. As long as it serves a page, then the link 
in the tracker list will work. A tracker should be able to verify 
that the server serving up the sites index file is NPDS by looking at 
the environment variables/HTTP headers? If people want to spoof NPDS 
headers, let them (I think that would be rare!). In other words, I 
don't think it makes sense to test /confirm.ns to see if /index.html 
is available. I don't really see why the whole traq/confirm pkg is 
necessary in the first place.

As regards logging, it is not hard to remove trackerbot hits from the 
log. It seems to me that a better way would be to make the logger 
(URLcop?) configurable so that the user could tell it not to log hits 
from certain servers, according to the user's needs.

All these ideas are great, but i'm just trying to get NPDS to be 
stable. Turning off the tracker has  brought a BIG improvement on my 
machine in the last few days. But sadly I am no longer listed. I will 
look into writing an alternative tracker that just looks once a day 
at the HTTP headers of the index page (the spoofers will be queuing 
up!  ;-) Obviously I will need to make it 'opt-in' and will have a 
'test/add to list now' button for the eager. Of course this may never 
happen...

You have my vote for 10ac! It is pretty solid on both of my Newtons that

Richard, you seem to experience unstable issues we all have with NPDS 
(please blame the developers, cf http://npds.free.fr for the guilty 
ones) but I'm pretty sure you're charging the wrong module.

Let me stress several points:

- when properly configured, the watcher only does reboot the Newton 
when the server went down. I have quite aggressive settings, but you 
probably want something like check every 5 minutes and check NS Task 
is alive. The watcher is definitely an improvement. With the watcher, 
a Newton can be logged on the tracker server for weeks.

- the server goes down mainly because of thread unsafety plus a 
couple of bugs left, although sometimes it's a -10061 and hadn't I 
taken part to NPDS, I would say that maybe NIE is guilty as well.

Originally (NPDS 2.0), NPDS wasn't able to serve more than one 
request at the same time. So it hadn't to be thread safe. One of the 
first thing I've done with NPDS was to change that, but it was a big 
dirty hack. Although some parts have been reworked so it doesn't work 
too bad, there remain some thread unsafeness.

It means that when several requests arrive at the same moment, bad 
things can happen. NewtonScript code is executed with cooperative 
threads (because the garbage collector itself isn't thread safe), but 
the problem is that NPDS is asynchronous and relies on global data 
here and there.

This definitely explains why you think NPDS is more stable without 
the tracker client. When you're registered, the tracker server sends 
a request every 30 minutes. This increases the chance of having two 
requests colliding and causing the crash. Serving index.html will 
worsen the problem, because NPDS will take longer to serve your 
index.html than the very short confirm.ns.

Personally, I gave up the idea of fixing the thread unsafeness 
problem since I've decided to rework the core with C++ code (this is 
known here as NPDS 3 project). I've been fixing bugs that I've 
introduced and others that were in NPDS 2.0, though, and sometimes I 
take a couple of hours browsing BugTrap's logs on Paul, Grant, Josh, 
John's and other's Newton websites and I try to fix bugs. At the 
moment I have to finish my two master's theses and find a director 
for my PhD of CS, so I definitely can't work on NPDS.

Now, you have the following choices:
- look in the change log about all the bugs I've fixed in 2.0 (some 
might not be listed, though) and start a new branch of NPDS that 
won't serve several pages at the same time but would be rock-solid. 
You don't need to port the Binary server since serving images 
embedded in pages won't work (as this is typically a case where 
multiple connections is required)
- take the current NPDS source code and try to fix some of the thread 
unsafeness.

But rewriting a new tracker server which you suggested in one of your 
messages would be a big waste of time, believe me.

It's not that I don't appreciate the numbering system, it's just that it 
doesn't match the versioning of the other modules. I'm guessing that "a" 
means "alpha"... but what does the "c" mean? Maybe I'm just confused.

Richard, could you possibly post a couple of screen captures of your NPDS 
Watcher prefs and your Tracker Client prefs windows? I am curious as to 
what you are using for settings. It a long shot, but I may have an answer 
for you.

Well, my server has been up for about 4 or 5 days now without a 
hitch. My settings are simple: traq is frozen and watcher is frozen. 
As they say, whatever gets you through the night. Sadly it means I am 
not listed on the trackers. To be honest, I was having so many and 
such regular problems with the traq client and watcher enabled that I 
am loath to go back. It may well have been that I set it up wrongly -

Subject: [NPDS] InetGrabLink Error

OK...After trying an experiment several days ago, My
NPDS server is now no longer functioning reliably.
Here is my setup:
My secondary 2100 has all NPDS stuff on an external
card. The Newt fires up, and the first thing it does
is return an "InetGrabLink Error -61001" message.
From here on, nHttpd is no longer stable. I reboot the
Newt and it comes back to life. I am able to start
nHttpd and it will run. Watcher will catch an error
(or I can force an error) and when the Newt returns
from a reboot, it will respond with the "InetGrabLink
Error -61001" message again. 
I've wiped my Newt completly. Full brain wipes.
Restored all NPDS stuff from my site
http://newton.tek-ed.com/newnpds which has all of the
latest stuff except for Watcher. (I believe it's 10ac)

What causes that InetGrabLink error? Which module is
throwing the error? Is there a way to circumvent this
error?

Ed, I think I found the cause of your problem, but your yahoo box box 
was full when I posted it to the list.

The problem is the default Internet setup. To fix it, open NPDS, then 
prefs, then show NIE connection slip (in admin I think), start NPDS, 
select your proper setting with the proper card and voilà.

Another cause might be that the ethernet driver and patches if any 
are not loaded early enough. Telling the watcher to wait for 5 
seconds, moving some stuff to the internal store, all that could help.

This is exactly what I have been dealing with. I temporarily fixed it 
using the wiper module but this got boring as I had to keep on 
re-entering the css stylesheet.

I have now made my 2100 stable by freezing the watcher and tracker modules.

While messing with NPDS style sheets, I decided to un-check "register

options to keep it from showing up on the tracker servers while I mess
around. However, now that I've done that, Tracker no longer appears in

anyone else experienced this? I'm using nhttpd 2.042 and tracker 2.035.

Yes, this is a design philosophy.

You need to go to the Extras drawer and tap the Tracker client icon. 
Then select "register with tracker server" and it will be activated. 
Once activated, it is in the list of NPDS plug-ins.

The plug-in registration scheme I've started to implement on NPDS 3 
is totally different. The list pops up immediatly and unactive 
plug-ins are just shown between parentheses (I might take some code 
from alt.rec.... to show their names with a different font face).

Sacrilege to contradict Paul G. and Adam T., I know, but after freezing both

months. We'll see how it does over the week end.

And I had visits from several folks who must have me bookmarked, or from
existing links to me (like Paul G's!), since I'm obviously not tracked any
more.

Apologies for not being able to keep up w/ BugReps etc lately, the day job

These stability issues have really got me perplexed. Every so often my 
NPDS will completely freeze up without an error message, and I'll have to 
force a reset, but generally the server will stay up and running for 
nearly a week at a time. I have never had to resort to disabling Watcher, 
let alone the Tracker client.

Very odd. I wonder what the difference in configuration of each system 
could be that would be causing this behavior.

I had the stability problem on a _very_ bare bones 2100 so I don't 
think it is a conflict problem. I think npds and the NIE/Farallon 
packages were all I had installed. That is when I discovered that 
freezing watcher and tracker massively improved stability. It still 
freezes without an error message but it does so every few days 
instead of every few hours.

>These stability issues have really got me perplexed.

Could I please re-explain my theory?

NPDS crashes because of several reasons, but mainly because of race conditions.

Race conditions happen when a connection arrives while another one is 
being processed. Maybe there needs more than two connections for NPDS 
to crash.

NPDS Watcher connects to the Newton on a periodical basis.
NPDS Tracker Server connects to the Newton as well. You can only 
change the watcher's period (in the settings).

If you disable both, probability of meeting the crashing race 
condition is much lower, although it can still happen (typically if 
you put plenty of Newton-served pictures in a page)
If you disconnect the Newton by unplugging the ethernet card and you 
also disabled the watcher, probability is zero.

(I'm not sure whether I'm using the "race condition" expression in a 
syntaxically correct way, computer scientists please correct me)

A "Race Condition" is:
A bug in a multithreaded process where the code of thread A relies on thread B
to complete some action, but where there is no synchronization between the two
threads. The process works if thread B wins the race by completing its action 
before thread A needs it, but the process fails if thread A wins the race.

Paul, when I get my extra 2100 (probably after I get back from Europe, so
July) would it be useful for me to run NPDS with Hammer on my Mac to see if
we can catch this?  I can just let it run all day until it crashes or fills
my hard drive with logs :)

Actually, no.
The problem is rooted in NewtonScript asynchronous I/O plus a lot of 
globals. There is no native preemptive thread in NPDS yet (and with 
these threads, I know how to have semaphores) except those coming 
from NewtonOS and NIE.

But I'm glad that you'll get a spare Newton and use it to serve web 
pages. My development Newton is serving web pages. It reboots quite 
often, but I think it's available most of the time.

This is strange. I am using the newest versions of NPDS except for 
Watcher is version 10ac. Both of my WIRELESS Newton NPDS servers stay up 
almost all of the time. They both have a lot of software installed on 
them, each with a different assortment.

I just stopped Watcher and Tracker last night and my

night!
The really weird thing is that my NPDS server was
running fine for the longest time! All of my NPDS
stuff sits on a 6mb card (including the notes) in a
seperate NPDS folder. The applications sit in an NPDS
group (all the extensions are in the extensions group)
and all the NPDS notes site in an NPDS folder.
I backed up my main Newt to a card, then restored to
my NPDS server (they are both exactly the same except
my main Newt is running Dashboard and Action Names and
my NPDS is not) When I did the restore, I had to
recreate the NPDS folders and groups and that was when
everything began to fail!
I have since performed many brain wipes and downloaded
fresh copies of NPDS from my webpage
nttp://newton.tek-ed.com/newnpds
Last night has been the longest my server has served
pages since!

Anybody have that?

by stopping and restarting NPDS. At least it's not

Ed:

The script you are looking for is in the NPDS online documentation, as 
an example of the Simple Scripting Architecture:

A cool way to see if NPDS is visible to the world.  Just type in your
servers address and see if it clicks.  (If your not using Tracker of course)

Was there ever a solution to the -16013 problem when registering w/ a
tracker?

I generate this error now whenever I register w/ the server.

I have the following setup, which I have wiped, hard reset, loaded earlier
releases and finally completely reloaded, to no avail... (problem on NIE
side?)

nHTTPd 2.043
Tracker Client 2.035
Watcher 1.0a12
NoteServ 2.045
Card Serv 2.01
DateServ 2.01
GIF Server 1.11
Web*Pager 2.023
Config 2.021

BTW, in cleaning up my NPDS packages spread over 3 computers, I noticed that
the "Date Modified" and version numbers as shown on the Newton are pretty
screwy for some of the pkgs...  e.g. NoteServ showed as v2.045 (the last
version loaded before wiping) even when I later loaded v2.01 -> is the
version number stored somewhere else that does not get deleted along w/ the
package?

I'm finally up again, but I have stopped registering due to the above...

Paul F, still hoping to again become an active Newtonian someday...

I had this happen to me when uninstalling and reinstalling different 
version of some of the packages (specifically NPDS Watcher). I used 
Standalone's Prefs Cleaner to nuke all of the hidden NPDS pref 
information and it seemed to clear things up.

Yeh - I tried Matt's "Wipe" too.  Now I have to find where the hit count is
hidden again...  Perhaps even SAI Prefs Cleaner is missing some of the
prefs...

After a reinstall and pref cleaning you have to be careful to follow Matt's
original instructions to run nHTTPd first, so it can locate the stores where
the plugins are located (re-filing later may cause problems). Matt's advice
is to put everything on the same store if possible.

Still suffering from "Connection aborted by disconnect"

Sigh.

Wipe will only work reliably on the old (released by me last century) 
versions of NPDS. If Paul has made substantial changes to the preferences 
system, it may not remove all the stored data. Thus, I'd use prefs cleaner 
in place of Wipe.

What I know is that there is some problem so there are several 
preferences entries, one per version or something like this.

Paul, you should use some pref cleaner or soup editor (do a backup 
first) or something like this. In the meanwhile, I'll try to find the 
time to update Wipe.

I definitely don't know what could be the cause of this -16013. Could 
you please provide BugTrap logs once you've had cleaned up the 
preferences?

I don't promise anything. I just spend too much time on my work.

Hi all (and especially Paul Filmer ;),

I've found the time to update Wipe.
This new version:
- removes preferences from any NPDS version from 2.0 to 3.x (Core package only)
- removes ghost entries (what I took for duplicate preferences)
- removes duplicate preferences if any.

Beware. This does things to the system soup. You probably want to do 
a backup first.

It's on http://npds.free.fr/ website (under Utilities). Source code 
is provided.

Paul, if you still have this error after cleaning your prefs with 
this new version of Wipe and resetting everything, please generate a 
BugTrap log if possible.

Regards,

Paul

Bad form follows (replying to my own post...)

Seems the -14100 resulted from changing dongles (who knew?).  I successfully
installed Wipe v1.02.

I have activated Bug Trap, but the -16013 does not seem to generate a

I've had a look at the code. Could you please tell me what the exact 
message of the error is? The tracker is based on a FSM and it shall 
tell you in which state the error occurred.

I guess it happens with only nHTTPd and the tracker enabled (i.e. 
every other package frozen).

Two successive error messages after attempting registration w/ a tracker

"Tracker Client
Oops, the server returned an error:" (no error reported)

and, after dismissal

"Tracker Client
An error occurred in Endpoint Connect: A communications problem occurred.
Connection may have been dropped. Error=-16013"

NPDS-related packages running (not frozen) are:
nHTTPd
Tracker Client
NPDS Watcher

This is a long known bug in the tracker client.

>Connection may have been dropped. Error=-16013"

OK. Do you have PT100? Can you try telnetting the tracker in your settings?
e.g. if your tracker server is shakti.continuity.cx, can you connect 
to shakti.continuity.cx on port 2110 from your Newton? from a desktop 
computer next to it?

I suspect a network problem. If I enter Matt's tracker addy in the 
settings, I get the -16013 exactly as you described, because Matt's 
tracker is down. So maybe something on your network is blocking the 
port/server.

Once you're connected, try to type "ABOUT" followed by return

That is definitely sounding like a firewall issue. Can you telnet to any 
other machines outside of your network? Is there any way of finding out 
what port traffic is allowed through the firewall. Perhaps there's an 
alternate port one of the trackers could run on.

Paul, you mentioned the following:

>Can you try telnetting the tracker in your settings?

Can you explain how you would do this? You obviously can't telnet 
directly to the shakti box (for example) because the connection will be 
refused. How would you send the commands from a telnet session. Excuse my 
ignorance, but I'm still fumbling around with the basics of telnet.

By using a telnet client to connect directly to the Tracker Server's port.
Try this, for example:

- grab a telnet client
- open a connection to misato.chuma.org port 2110
- once the connection is established, type "ABOUT" and hit Enter

the result will look something like this:

[chuma@misato chuma]$ telnet misato.chuma.org 2110
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to misato.
Escape character is '^]'.
ABOUT
200 OK

share: true
about: NPDSTracker for Java version 0.1.29 running on Java 1.2.2 by Sun

Connection closed by foreign host.

This way you can see that the tracker is alive, issue commands, access the
admin console if you are the admin etc.

OK. Can you telnet on shakti.continuity.cx on port 8080?
If you can, set that setting into the tracker client. You can set the 
HTTP port to either 2110 or 8080.

Hmmm... do you have static IPs for the two newts? That would be one 
explanation...

Or perhaps you are running a DYNDNS client on a PC on your network, and 
that is updating the dynamic DNS server, and you have some kind of port 
forwarding arrangement on a NAT router?

Domains associated with dynamic IP addresses have to be updated whenever 
there is an IP change so either you have static IPs, or something else on 
your network is updating the DYNDNS server. I don't believe the Newts can 
do it.

Jeremy:

Without going and looking, I believe I set it up with port 
forwarding. This is all done sharing one static IP with ipnetrouter 
and an airport basestation. I have several macs and a newton or two 
connected at most times. The address I gave you went to a setup that 
no longer requires me log on every 30 days for updating the address. 
My newt just has the same fixed settings and I've been good to go 
that way for months.

Hope that helps.

Thanks to the kind folks who do the coding for the trackers, I was able to
get around the blocking of port 2110 by our firewall with the addition of
port 8080 to shakti.

I just noticed that 

http://shakti.continuity.cx:2110

has a different list from

http://shakti.continuity.cx:8080

in that while 8080 lists all the registered servers, 2110 lists only those
coming in through 2110 (or so it seems, because my Newt only appears on
8080).

"Just a simple complication"


BTW - does anybody else on this list have a "lost server" that cannot
register?  I have started a little list of them, and have Dale Steele's
server listed there...

Thanks

Er. You can access http://shakti.continuity.cx:2110 at work?
I thought it was firewalled.

Er. I really get the same list on both ports. And frankly, looking at 
the code, I really can't figure out how it could be different. There 
is a single list.

Did you check that the counter on the page increased? Maybe your 
browser cached the version of the page. This is really weird because 
you got the page first, registered and then hit the page twice (I 
guess one per port):

I realize that a missing feature is putting the port in the log.

in that while 8080 lists all the registered servers, 2110 lists only those
coming in through 2110 (or so it seems, because my Newt only appears on
8080).

Hey, that's the idea Paul Filmer and I were discussing recently. I 
like the idea too but when I tried to visit just now, I didn't get a

I know, it doesn't make mush sense to put the "lost servers" listing on an
unstable page, but my Newt is what I've got handy... I'm up again after
being out of the office this AM.

I find my server lasts about an hour before it crashes into something the
Watcher cannot recover from.  Sigh.  Probably something in the network here,
given that I see others serving seemingly endlessly.

I was having the same type of problem so I just pulled the watcher

go down. Of course, I have a lot less traffic this way and miss the 
visits and exchanges of ideas.

From: Grant Hutchinson <nospam_grant_at_splorp_dot_com>

Woo hoo!

My NPDS server passed the 30,000 hit mark today.

Not only that, but I think I've discovered a little trick to keeping NPDS 
Watcher doing its job properly. Up until now, I've had the Watcher 
automatically minimizing itself upon restart. On a hunch, I unchecked 
this preference three days ago. Since then I haven't had a freeze or a 
non-restart due to an error. It seems that as long as NPDS Watcher isn't 
minimized, it will work perfectly. It is much more inconsistent and will 
not catch all of crashes when it's minimized.

Those of you who have had issues with the Watcher being unable to restart 
the Newt should check to see if this preference is active.

Grant:

Wow, that's a lot of hits, and I know I made a few of them...

I didn't even realize there was a minimize feature with the watcher 
so perhaps I was using an older version. I haven't used it for a 
while and have not been registering with a tracker. That helped for a 
while but now things seem to be down again anyway. I'm going to try 
and check this out this weekend.

Thanks for the tip.

p.s. I think my two newton NPDS servers might add up to 11,000 hits combined.

From: Paul Guyot <nospam_pguyot_at_kallisys_dot_net>
Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] Watcher 0013ac

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce NPDS Watcher 0013ac.
This new watcher no longer has the 5 seconds wait option on reboot 
before starting the server. Instead, it will wait until NIE is fully 
loaded and start the server in that case. It looks 15 times separated 
by 5 seconds each and display a dialog if NIE isn't active then.

You can find it on the npds website.

I've developed that change because I moved NPDS to the internal store 
and the watcher failed with an error -48808.

BTW, I'm working on a workaround for the Listen CB -60049. It seems 
to be fine so far. I'll see how stable my Newton is. Don't hesitate 
to come and visit it.

The cast of characters:

16Mb card (bottom slot)
nHTTPd 2.034 (all pkgs on internal, index.html & all notes on the card (a

Watcher 1.0a13 (launch, no min, 5, check, no reboot dialog, 60 sec)


The behaviour:

(enter, stage left) Reboot countdown executes properly.

"Closing open connections" dialog remains up. (dismissible)

Error floater - "Sorry, a problem has occurred: -48803" (dismissible)

nHTTPd reads "Disconnected"

LED on Ethernet card is out.

No BugCatcher note was generated.

No reboot occurs.

nHTTPd serves fine after manual restart (no reboot).

I got that problem this morning, with a bug trap log. I wondered if 
it was latest nHTTPd or latest watcher.

If you hung out in EFNet #newton, you'd see that the new features include

LOL.
Er, no, this was my SQL optimizer and it was a java issue. 
Fortunately, I replaced it with a null pointer issue which, you'll 
agree, is much better. I'll have to fix that tomorrow at work. The 
good news is that my internship ends on Friday, so I'll have time 
(not this week-end because I'll go to the country) to work on some 
Newton projects for three weeks, before starting my two PhDs :-/

New features include mostly a workaround for the -60049 problem.
I'm also doing various experiments to increase the stability. Hence 
the uptime on my server (the second one, in DD:HH:MM:SS format, which 
is a new feature as well -- the first uptime is when the Newton was 
last restarted and is provided by a script plus a simple package I've 
written).

Once I'll be happy with it, I'll post it, I promise.

Apparently, there are two choices:
- listening just after having said to the TCP/IP stack to accept the 
incoming connection
- listening just when the TCP/IP told us it accepted the connection

The first one makes the Newton more receptive to incoming requests 
while the second one seems a little bit more stable (avoiding bad 
restarts of the Newton thanks to the NS Task Watcher).

I want to investigate a little bit further.
Of course, the best choice would be:
- listen as soon as the TCP/IP stack accepted the connection but 
before it tells the NewtonScript task about it (aka C++ Internet).
Or maybe there is a way to have an endpoint that always listens and 
client endpoints, as in most TCP/IP stacks (both socket and endpoint 
based).

Hey Paul.

Well, after installing 014ac last night, my server rebooted once and that 
was all. Right now, it's sitting at home, not receiving any connections. 
I'll double check whether or not it generated a BugTrap report when I get 
home tonight, but I would guess it didn't. In order to test this new 
Watcher, I did minimize it. The previous version I was running (010ac) 
was able to keep rebooting when necessary for nearly three weeks straight 
prior to me upgrading to 014ac. I was running it unminimized.

I'll just answer my own question here...

It seems that the reason my server wasn't accepting connections was 
because it wasn't started. At any rate, I nuked the Watcher prefs just to 
be on the safe side, reset all the settings, and we seem to be in 
business. I do get the odd dialog box stuck on the screen after Watcher 
does a soft-restart on the server:

     http://www.splorp.com//junk/screenclosing020912.gif

It just sits there and sits there. Any one else getting this?

Subject: [NPDS] Tech: server endpoint, client endpoints

Hi all,

I'm posting here the technical details about server endpoint and 
client endpoints. This is actually to prepare yourself to the not so 
stable nHTTPd 2.044 (to be released on Monday).

With a serious TCP/IP stack, you have a socket or an endpoint 
(depending on its being based on sockets or endpoints) that listens 
for incoming requests and many other sockets/endpoints that process 
the requests.

This is how NewtonOS communication layer works, and I expect NIE to 
work likewise.

Except that to access this communication layer, the current only 
stable way is via the NewtonScriptEndpointClient. And this stupid 
class tells the lower layer to use the listening endpoint for 
handling requests.

Consequently, nHTTPd will *always* miss incoming requests between the 
moment the connection arrived and the moment another endpoint is told 
to listen.

We can have mainly symptoms:

- if a request arrives before nHTTPd has accepted another connection, 
that request will never be told that it failed.
- if a request arrives after nHTTPd has accepted another connection 
but before the new endpoint is setup and listening, that request will 
be told that the port isn't open.

nHTTPd 2.044 currently attempts to create tell the other endpoint to 
listen before it received the confirmation that the previous one was 
accepted. It seems quite stable and we get more requests like this, 
although we are missing a lot of them.

So folks, for a perfectly stable nHTTPd that receives many requests, 
you'll need NIL. This is called NPDS 3.x and it's definitely not 
ready for production.

Well, some observations about high hit rates:

Seems quite stable, considering.  A few -60049s, one -16003, and several
total freezes so far.

The log gets overwhelmed (I had it at 32/720) so I eventually stopped
logging and gave up on resolving DNS.  Have at it, slashdotters.  I have my
"Steve-Jobs-as-target" backdrop up for all those who take screenshots.
Nyah-nyah-nyah.

I'm even considering having nHTTPd not click on hits, and making the
GIFServer silent so that I can get some work done - but extended silence has
been a good sign that something is actually wrong.

Apparently pudge of /. is a Newton user, given some of his comments
regarding other's posts.  Hmm.

It was a valiant struggle, but...

The clicker could not keep up with it, and now the Newt refuses to launch
NPDS properly, regardless of resets or NPDS wipes.  It's stuck with an open
connection immediately on launch, so I am giving up on trying to keep my
website going.

Paul,

Since the change you made to the Watcher back in version 011ac, where it 
attempts to restart the server process rather than rebooting the device, 
I've had the problem with freezing and requests not being accepted. This 
is exactly what was happening this past week while I was running and 
testing 014ac. I have gone back to using Watcher 010ac (unminimized) and 
I have not had any freezing or serving issues. If something goes wrong, 
the Newton reboots and everything start running again the way it should.

Would it be possible to add another preference to the Watcher that let's 
you choose between restarting the server process and rebooting the Newton?

Subject: [NPDS] [ANN] nHTTPd 2.044

Hi all,

I've finally got rid of the old TCP Server and I replaced it with 
something based on what I started for late NPDS 2.1.

It seems very stable so far. It uses a pool of endpoints instead of 
creating one when required. This pool is initialized with two 
endpoints and will grow if more are required. It fixes a big problem 
in the old server that leaded to the closing connection dialog that 
doesn't go away.

Please note that you can install it but this is not for the faint 
hearted. Please get BugTrap running if you use it.

You can help by coming by my Newton and trying to crash it.
Check the uptime on the first page to know if you succeeded. ;)
If you read my technical explanation earlier on this list, you'll 
know that it's normal if some connection fail. I think that this 
server is better than previous ones (because in fact, endpoints in 
the pool are already bound, I only need to tell them to Listen while 
previous versions of NPDS did the full instantiate/bind/listen 
series).

BTW, this new release also includes the <SERVER-UPTIME>. Consider 
that as an undocumented feature.

I tried to write a NPDS script to access the fortunes application.
I followed the info on Paul's site and on the NPDS site, but it doesn't 
work.
What am I doing wrong ???

The error I get when I test the script is :
----

end

I tried different syntaxes for the GetRandomFortune(), but same results.

Thnx

There is a problem in your script.
To access the fortunes application (or any application), you need to do:
GetRoot().<app symbol>

If <app symbol> includes any special caracter such as a column, you 
need to put the vertical bars:
e.g.
GetRoot().|Fortunes:Kallisys|

So your script should work by just adding 'GetRoot().'

I think I shall have mentioned that on my website.

Now, I am using Fortunes as well on my NPDS website (which has a 17 
hours uptime, i.e. the watcher hasn't restarted the application for 
17 hours which is approximatively when I built the non debug version 
of 2.044. Apparently, Ron is running it. Anyone else tried?).

My script adds two things.
First, I return an empty string if the fortunes application isn't present.
This can be done the following way:

func(foobar)
begin
local frame fortunesApp := GetRoot().|Fortunes:Kallisys|;
if (fortunesApp) then
begin
	...
	... return theOut;
end else
	return "";
end

Additionally, I replace < by &lt;, > by &gt;, & by &amp;, \n by 
<br>\n and \t by "&nbsp;&nbsp;"

This is done by five lines like:
StrReplace(theOut, "	", "&nbsp;&nbsp;", nil);

Before return theOut;

Thanks Paul,

I reread the NPDS documentation and the GetRoot() is mentioned there.
It now works fine.

I must say that version 2.044 with the latest version of the NPDS 
watcher runs more stable than the previous versions.
The only 'bug' I found so far is that the log is empty when I access it

This is a known bug, but it's not very likely that I will fix it.
Indeed, NPDS was written for a single connection at the same time. I 
have hacked it so it processes the connection more or less thread 
safely until it generates the statistics.
Fixing that would require refounding NPDS entirely. And many many 
parts should be replaced by native code.

Now that I should make a couple of NPDS users happy, let's focus on 
ATA Support beta 14. Please folks show your uptime as mine is going 
to be lost with restarts caused by ATA Support tests and installs and 
debugging sessions with that stupid Hammer Debugger.

Subject: [NPDS] 2.044 bugs

Hi folks,

I'm pretty happy with 2.044 and if I don't see any major problem, it 
will become the recommended version.

Nevertheless, I found two bugs. Feel free to give me more details 
about them if you experience them as well.
a/ the communication problem occurred dialog. This dialog appears 
under some circumstances I can't reproduce, and a bug trap log is 
generated. However, the server is still serving. I think I should 
simply catch this exception and ignore it.
b/ a big number error just appeared on my Newton and it stopped 
serving. Here the big number probably comes from NIE weirdeness. 
However, the bug is that I got the alert saying that the server 
wasn't up anymore because the error was fatal and the server actually 
didn't stop. Plus the watcher will probably not recognize these 
alerts as NPDS alerts/restart the server if it stops too nicely. 
However, the other test of the watcher (listen test) will succeed and 
it shall reboot the Newton (yes, I'm aware of the restart/reboot 
issue on the watcher).

Paul Filmer apparently runs 2.044. Paul, can you please post a 
feedback in a couple of days? If the (b) problem is very rare (like I 
said, I got a bus error while nHTTPd doesn't include a single line of 
native code, so it must be NIE), nHTTPd should be the recommended 
one. It will remain more stable than previous versions.

So, do you recommend that I use Watcher 014ac with this version of nHTTPd 
in order to test everything the same way as you and Paul F.?

Considering that Paul's Newton is currently down, I don't recommend 
anything. At least, you might want to stay with the watcher you have 
that reboots the Newton until Paul tells us why his Newton went down.

Well, I have the same problem as always, now only more so. :)

Reboot-relaunch occurs, but without a connection to the net.  This has been
a problem since the beginning of Watcher. The new twist is that Watcher is
somehow detecting something is wrong, and rebooting at the NS task check
frequency, whereas before it was perfectly happy to sit and wait for
requests that never came.

Unfortunately I cannot seem to reproduce the crash that causes this cycle to
start. However, once I realize this is happening, I can hit "Stop" (which
generates the only BugRep available), and try to relaunch or reset manually.

For you to see the BugRep, I'll have to get NPDS up and running... (I may
have to reload 043)

Then there's also the fact that I am not sure I got rid of all the /.
fallout...  I know /.ers were deliberately trying to crash the server since
there is no other reason for the 15-20 consecutive screenshots I got for the
last few days.  Grr.  Glad I had a backup of the site.

Pudge did apologize though.

In fact, there was a real problem. Fixed.

It was in fact some old reference to the old tcp server. Fixed.

Plus a couple of others I don't recall of.

There is now a fixed size of the EP pool (reason: NIE won't create 
more than 16 anyway).
You can set this limit with Setup 2.022 in Admin panel.
Please note that I'm not entirely sure that you don't need to set the 
value before running 2.045. Default is 8. I suggest to not set it 
over 12. Apache equivalent settings' default is 200.

All that is on the website. Enjoy ;)

Paul,

Have you considered changing the default port on the server? Some of the 
issues you were experiencing prior ot being /.-ed sound awfully like the 
same things that happened to my server after the Code Red virus started 
propagating way back when. Coudl some of instability be coming from 
malformed requests? As an added bonus, it might confuse the /.-ers for a 
while if you switch ports, especially if some dipwad has set up a 
automatic script to hit your /screen/ directory non-stop. I know that 
switching my server to a non-default HTTP port stopped most of the 
problems with crap requests coming from Code Red and its kind.

Just a thought.

I don't have a EP pool field in the Admin panel. I installed 2.022 and 
even wiped my prefs (and my hit count along with them :P) but no 
additional setting appears in NPDS setup.

What's up with that?

On a related topic, how hard would it be to edit the soup entry where the 
hit count is stored? I'd really like to get my hits back up to the 36,500 
level again...

It's not hard.  It's stored in the nHTTPd:AllPen entry in your System
soup.  Or some other entry with nHTTPd as the tag.

Ok, I found the entry using SBM Utilities, but it won't let me edit it 
without registering. I think I'll go ahead and pay the $39, but is there 
another soup editor that will let me edit the entry now? Stewpot can't

Can you please make a screen shot of the admin panel?

Thanks in advance.

BTW, apparently, I still have some communication problem occurred 
dialogs. But it seems that it's because there is a conflict in the 
number of EPs with:
a/ tracker
b/ watcher
c/ resolver (for stats)

I'll study that later. There is no hurry since it serves 
nevertheless. Please give me as many details to help me debugging 
2.045 as you can.

Thanks.

BTW, the setting is called Max Clients (this is the name of Apache's 
equivalent setting). There is a popup with 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16.
I have issues with the tracker (when it connects to the server 
regularly) at 12.
There seem to be a bug with the code that downsize the number of EPs 
so if you downsize it, you'll need to stop the server and restart it.

8 (the default value) seems to be what you want.

Can't set Prefs on most of the plug-ins.  They appear in nHTTPd pick list,

up, but error is generated when Prefs is selected from within Watcher

Some of it seems to be linked to the default store choice - I have the pkgs

This seems to be a problem with the preferences that cannot be found 
or something like that. Did you wipe anything?

I don't think this is a 2.045 issue but rather an existing problem in 
the way preferences are handled by NPDS (there is some update 
mechanism shared among the plug-ins).
Do you experience the problems after a reboot?

Also, I read about your issues to watcher successfully restart the 
web server on Newton reboot. Which version of the watcher are you 
running?

You always have to reboot after trashing the NPDS preferences. They are 
rebuilt to default settings when the packages are installed after a 
reboot. I know the mechanism gets picked on a bit in this discussion 
group, but I tend to think it's actually rather elegant :-)

Okay. Now, I understand.
If you wipe the prefs, a reboot is mandatory (I suspected the wipe 
because your Newton says 45K hits since today!).
This is because of the way preferences are handled through NPDS.

However, I never do wipes myself and I try to do my best so you don't 
have to do any either (the only reason might be instabilities or 
switching back to an older version).

Gah. This update was specifically designed to address issues like the 
one you are experiencing.

What about putting the watcher on the memory card (and just the watcher)?

It is Matt, the only problem is exactly what you describe plus that 
it took me time to understand under which circumstances the prefs 
were actually reset. I recall the discussions here when Paul was 
fighting to keep his 5 or 10K counter then.

Since I don't know which version, the prefs are never reset on 
package update. Instead, they are updated: slots that no longer exist 
are removed and slots that are new are added. I'm not sure my code is 
very reliable there.

Done. (You gotta love Daniel Padilla's Screen Shooter!)

By the way, I also woke up this morning to find this Communications error 
message on the screen. It occurred sometime last night. The Newton was 
still serving, so I just dismissed the message. The process hasn't been 
restarted yet either. I've have nearly thirteen hours uptime so far.

     http://www.splorp.com/junk/screencomunications020917.gif

I think the error message corresponds to this BugTrap report:

It's nice and it uses NPDS technology ;)

Grant, this is Setup 2.021
I guess you took the .sit archive with the source code. I did a 
mistake and the 2.022 archive on the website was actually the 2.021 
source code (what is weird is that you didn't notice when expanding 
it as the folder is called 2.021).

Anyway, I've uploaded the correct archive.
The package seems to be the right version.

>By the way, I also woke up this morning to find this Communications error

Yes, I got it as well. I can't reproduce it. Unlike another cause for 
that error that was a bug in my code, I think here it's that the 
client actually disconnected before or while the Newton disconnects.

>The process hasn't been restarted yet either. I've have nearly

It now says 14 hours. Isn't that new version soooo stable?

You don't need to stop the server to install Setup 2.022.

Damn.  I really thought putting it on the card might work, delaying the boot
until the card had finished reloading (since my connection always seems to
drop during card package loading).  But I just went through a reboot cycle
with no luck - up and serving, but without a connection.

Gah. This update was specifically designed to address issues like the 
one you are experiencing.

What about putting the watcher on the memory card (and just the watcher)?

Subject: [NPDS] Latest versions loaded - no server
From: John Skinner <nospam_john.skinner_at_vanderbilt_dot_edu>

Preface: Paul, I know that you are updating things, I'm just trying to help
figure out issues :)


I just backed up one of my 2100s and brianwiped it.

I figured it would be a good time to try out all the new updates from Paul
Guyot on a fresh Newton!

I installed all parts from the 2100 CD for NIE 2.0 and Paul's "NIE update
3", my Farallon and 3Comaddon, and 802.11 WaveLAN registered version 1.05.

Then, I downloaded and installed all the newest packages on to a Pretec 32MB
card (everything else is on internal), and now I have some strange things to
add to the ongoing discussions.

I hadn't noticed that the Setup, once expanded, was version 2.021. Thanks
for pointing that out Paul, as I would not have noticed having downloaded
all the latest version at once.

When I open nHTTPd and tap on start, I get the connection slip O.K.

Then the TrackerClient seems to connect to the Tracker server and register
O.K.

The problem is nHTTPd still says "Not Connected" at the top, but the main
button says "Stop" and there is no x box to quit. Now that nHTTPd is in this
state it will not answer any requests, but halfway acts like it is running.

This is where I'm at so far. I will download Setup 2.022 and install it when
I get home tonight.

This won't change anything. Setup is just a GUI for the settings.

What would be helpful is to install BugTrap to see if anything is generated.
Something else would be to connect the Newton to the internet by 
other means (for example with an internet application like 
SimpleMail, Newtscape or Internet Setup Apple's NIE tool) and to run 
the server afterwards, to see if it improves things.

I too am experiencing pretty much the same behavior as John.  I need to

Yes.

"Notes in my notepad" (<NOTE_LIST> I guess) is the list of notes that 
weren't posted and that are in the Posts folder.
"Posts" (<POST_LIST>) is the list of notes that were posted and that 
are in the Posts folder.

The notes in the "Folder" Folder are also accessible with NPDS.

If you specify two different folders (labels) in the NoteServ 
preferences, you can have notes that can be linked to that don't 
appear in the notes list.

The link format is either:
/html/<title of the note>
or
/html/<virtual ID of the note>

Subject: [NPDS] Towards NPDS 3, let's summarize

Hi all,

First, even if there is that disconnecting bug (btw, it actually 
disables an endpoint), I consider that the new nHTTPd is stable 
enough to work as it for a while. So I can focus on NPDS 3.x.

I would like to summarize the features of NPDS 3.x. I had a colleague 
at INRIA who was convinced that HTTP-based personal data sharing for 
PDAs is the way to go. And in fact, he convinced me as well. So I 
would like to work towards Matt's initial idea, which is making NPDS 
a web interface for the data on the Newton, instead of stressing the 
pure web serving part which I was more interested it.

I think that NPDS shall allow us to view and modify data on the 
Newton. But not like on the Newton itself, it should rather be a 
publish mechanism with some update mechanisms whenever a keyboard and 
a big screen are more suitable than pen.

My problem with that was that I don't really want to publish my card 
file on the web. Some of us do it but I think that most don't. I 
don't want to publish my agenda either, etc.

Therefore we come to the core of NPDS features:
- it shall have a user login/logout interface that must be optional 
(guest mode). I hate it when I have to login on Apple's website. This 
means handling cookies. This also means that there should be 
permissions within the plug-ins. For example people in some group 
could see your card file and only you can modify it. This login thing 
will replace the Notes post/web pager identity.
- it shall have a website aspect that can be customized with themes. 
We can all customize the web pages but plug-ins shall be 
customizable. Using CSS might be sufficient, however it means that 
plug-ins must rely much more on CSSes. For that part, I wish the 
talented web designers on the list make some mock NPDS 3.x websites 
with various themes so the layman Newton user could just pick one in 
a popup. I think we discussed that already. I trust the CSS experts 
to tell me what should define a given theme.
- the notes server will be merged with works and splitted in several parts:
* web structure (including error documents, etc.) and themes notes 
(which could be in works) will be merged into the core module. They 
are always required. This also means that there will not be a default 
module on the contrary to 2.x. I don't think anyone doesn't use Notes 
as the default module. This module will include admin posting feature 
(i.e. something that let you add notes to the Newton with 
permissions).
* there could be a bulletin board module (replacing posting 
notes/listing of owner's notes).
* there should be a Wiki module.
* there might be a blog-like module.
- the gif server module shall be splitted in two parts:
* the gif encoder shall go into the core (and could be used to serve 
themes picture elements). I might add png and jpeg encoding.
* the screen module will display the screen content and let you (with 
permissions) click on it. Like VNC but via HTTP with authentication.
- the dates and card file modules shall let you modify/add entries
- the binary module will be merged into core because it is required 
for themes pictures.
- the tracker will stay as a separate module. Some people here don't 
use it and it's not because it brings instability, it's because they 
don't want/can't share their Newton.
- the watcher shall be merged into the core. The part that checks 
that NPDS is still serving is mainly a workaround for bugs. But it 
has two other interesting features that we might want to keep: (a) it 
restarts NPDS on reboot (except at Paul Filmer's) and (b) it reboots 
if the NS task seemed to crash (this can happen if some other 
software crashed it).
- there shall be some mechanism (probably HTTP based) to update pages 
and content remotely. This will go into Core.

So in the end, we'll have:
- Core
- BB
- Wiki
- Blog
- Screen
- Tracker
- Dates
- Card File
- Pager

What did I forget? Is there any feature that you would like to see?

And the next question: do you want to help and how?

Hi all. With the discontinuation of free mac.com web pages, I am in

Matt, we can host your site on dev.newtontalk.net, which is specifically 
for people doing Newton development.  Mail webmaster@newtontalk.net (I 
don't handle it, someone else does) and ask.

I think it would be nice to be able to reply to a "Pager" message, like
invoking a form of instant messaging.

For example;
If I had my Newton running (the future) NPDS 3 and someone sent me a Pager"
message..

I would have the choice to dismiss the message window (like WebPager),
OR,
I could tap a "Reply" button (that might even load a third-party messaging
program, i.e. Chatbuddy, NewtCQ, NewtJabber etc.) and start a chat session.



I know that not everyone might want this type of functionality from NPDS 3,
but it's just my 2 cents!

Yes.  This would probably mean that the alternative messaging method would 
have to be sent along with the message, which means that the sender would 
have to have the info entered somewhere - most logically, in their owner's 
card.

I actually used to have something like this running on a webpage a long 
time ago.  I could send someone a webpager message from a special form I 
had (entering their IP address), and then when they replied they would go 
to another form (not on an NPDS server) where they could send an SMS in 
reply.

Thanks for the recommendation Gary, but I think I'll defer to Victor's 
developer hosting offer on the NewtonTalk server. I think that makes more 
sense. Of course, as much as I'd like to see the older NPDS information 
archived for reference and posterity, we also need to start think about 
revamping and consolidating all of the documentation into one place. 
Maybe the npds.free.fr site is a more logical choice of venue.

Naturally, if the sites don't work out, I'd be happy to host it on the 
Newted server. I'll even reserve 'npds' as an account username.

But this would mean that people who use Screen Shooter would have to keep 
an old version of GIF server around, or have NPDS core installed... or am 
I misunderstanding you?   Why not just make the GIF encoder a library like 
zlib?

The tracker and the tracker server should also implement the stuff that 
we've dreamed about it doing: sending lon/lats for map graphing, possibly 
other cool stuff.  I forget now, it's been so long since we talked about 
it.  Maybe x-face images, for fun?

Web*Pager could be so much cooler, as was already noted.

I mentioned the tracker stuff.  I'm not sure how else I can help...

I need more time to chew through all the options and possibilities, but I 
think we've already got about 90% of my wish list covered already.

>And the next question: do you want to help and how?

I've already mentioned in previous threads that I'd like to be involved 
in renovating the documentation, as well as designing a series of 
html/xhtml/css compliant templates or perhaps something called NPDS 
SiteSkins(tm).

In order to work on the latter, I'd like to start compiling a list of 
pages and web interfaces that each module would use, the various levels 
of information hierarchy on those pages, and so forth.

Oh, I'm so excited...

Oh yeah, I forgot Screen Shooter. 'Kay, it should be a library-like

(and the png encoder will actually be part of the ZLib because of 
their relationship).

Great, a new dream-like idea for the tracker: x-faces.

Yes. In fact, we discussed about these improvements a while back on that list.

Indeed, this is what to start with. Please don't forget error pages 
(with permissions, we'll have at least 404, 403 and 500). Everything

All that is reasonable. Nobody asked for PHP support yet.

I think the best option is to host the NPDS portion of the old 
Lightyear Design site on npds.free.fr. I'll upload it soon and change 
the various redirects around the net to point to the new location.

Thanks for all the great offers, guys.

Hi Paul.

Here's an error I've never run across before. I'm assuming that it's part 
of the newer TCP code. The following message was on the screen this 
morning. The server was open, but not started. See screen dump:

     http://www.splorp.com/junk/screenprototcperror020924.gif

I believe that these two BugTrap reports correspond to the error. Both 
are timestamped the same, so they occurred consecutively.

     http://207.34.68.38:8080/html/-72365934$706.nsd
     http://207.34.68.38:8080/html/-72365934$707.nsd

I hope this helps.

Indeed. You shouldn't see that. ;)

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out what the problem was 
from your screen shots. This sounds like a bus error within NIE code. 
There was similar errors because of a bug but it was triggerred by a 
NewtonScript error that I saw in BugTrap logs.
I'll try to find^Wmake the time to update the watcher so it reboots 
the Newton when it finds this kind of error messages that you're not 
supposed to see.

Although there's a certain charm to having your error messages appear in

I do not know whether it is applicable or not, but keep in mind that I am 
still using version 010ac of the Watcher and not the latest one.

Humph.  No - same thing.  Reboots, but the inet cxn is dropped during the
card pkg loading, and NPDS is up & running but w/o cxn, and then never
reboots after that because there are no incoming queries to change its
state.

Is it possible to include the version number of packages when using the

If so, what do you add to the script?

I haven't seen that script, but you can get the version integer slot 
from a package.

There are two options. The package script iterates on the icons with 
the Extras Drawer. In that case, you don't have a package ref, but 
you have the package symbol. You need to figure out for each package 
on which store they are. And then, you get the reference to package 
ref with:
local frame thePkgRef := GetPkgRef("symbol as string", <store>);
Then you get the information about that package with:
GetPkgRefInfo(thePkgRef);

But this option is probably not what happens. If it is, it's not very 
easy to figure out which store the icon is on.

The most probable design of the package list script is via 
GetPackages() method. This method returns pkgref info structures 
(what GetPkgRefInfo returns). And there is a slot called version.

Now, please note that the version slot very rarely reflects the 
public version of the package. The first reason is that the version 
slot is an integer, not a float. The second reason is that one easily 
forgets to update the version slot, when one knows about it.

First we should determine whether WebPage appears broken because there's 
an installation or package problem, or if it appears broken because Paul 
Filmer's Newton went offline right after the sent the page.

I've received recent WebPages and have been able to reply without a 
problem.

Does anyone have any experiance with this, or have suggestions?

I'm setting up Jaguar (Mac OS X 10.2) as the SLIP server.

Start with connecting to the internet via SLIP,
then setup NPDS. The public IP field in the
tracker client must be your G4's and you need to
enable port forwarding from the G4 to the Newton.

What did you end up doing to get your NPDS server back up and running 
decently? It's nice to see you listed on the trackers again.

Yes, I was about to ask this as well.
You seem to have nHTTPd 2.045 as mentioned here:

And you mention the latest watcher.

Did the problems disapear, or I should make one or two hours to work on it?

Anyway, glad to see you back.

I simply de-activated Watcher, and that obviously solved the frequent

You know...it's interesting that you say that...
I too was having problems with my NPDS server crashing
on a regular basis. At least once per day, often
more...
it got so bad that all I could run was just the NPDS
server. The Watcher and the Tracker caused '61 errors.

Now? All of a sudden it works! I didn't change ANY of
the files...they are all the same versions...but I am
now able to run the NPDS and the Watcher! I still
can't run the Tracker, but my server's been serving
smoothly for almost a week! (of course, it's going to
crash now...)
One thing though...now when it crashes...it crashes
HARD! It crashes so hard, that a reboot will not work.
I've got to remove all power for about 5
minutes...then, and only then will it come back to
life. Oh well, weekly maintenance is better than
daily!

What is the easiest way to create a list of the most recent notes posted 
using the whiteboard? I'd like to show the 5 or 10 newest notes on my 
NPDS home page and move the full <POST_LIST> to another page. Is there 
any way to script this in order to create an SSI function? Or do I have 
to manually edit a separate note to refer to the individual posts?

Yes. It's exactly what I do on my Newton.

Pfff. You've got time to waste. The Newton almost sleeps the whole 
day and you want to do it yourself?

You need to replace '|NPDSBoard| by the actual symbol of your posted 
notes folder. You might also change count to 4 and 3 (as in len < 3) 
to 5.

// Récupère la liste des 3 derniers messages.
func(NullVariable)
begin
	// 1-Récupération de la liste des messages.
	// Tableau avec les entrées.
	local array entrées := [];
	// Curseur sur la soupe.
	local frame curseur := GetUnionSoup("Notes"):query({tagspec: 
{equal: ['|NPDSBoard|]}, indexPath: 'timestamp});
	// On cycle parmi les entrées.
	local frame entrée := curseur:entry();
	while( entrée ) do
	begin
		// On l'ajoute.
		addarrayslot(entrées, entrée);
		// Au suivant!
		entrée := curseur:next();
	end;

	// 2-Extraction des plus récents.
	// Je ne vais quand même pas trier à la main, non?
	entrées:= sort(entrées, '|>|, 'timestamp);

	// Par défaut, pas de note disponible.
	local string theResult := "<p><b>No post present.</b></p>\n";

	// Combien en ai-je?
	local int len := length( entrées );
	if (length( entrées ) > 0) then
	begin
		// Zoli entête.
		theResult := "<p><b>Most recent posts:</b></p>\n<ul>\n";
		// Je peux en avoir moins de 3.
		local int count := 2;
		if (len < 3) then count := len - 1;
		for index_p := 0 to count do
		begin
			// Je récupère l'entrée.
			entrée := entrées[ index_p ];
			// J'ai besoin de son titre.
			local string titre := entrée.title;
			// Si le visiteur a été flemmard, il faut générer
			// un titre bidon.
			if not StrFilled(titre)

Ok, I've been playing with this script, but I'm stuck. Is the "actual 
symbol" of the posted notes folder simply the name of the folder? Or am I 
missing something? When I replace '|NPDSBoard| with '|Whiteboard| I get a 
NewtonScript error: "evt.ex.fr.type,type.ref.frame". Do I need to 
specific or reference something else? I've tried all sort of variations 
attempting to reference my Whiteboard folder.

Still trying to learn NS...

Usually, yes.
In fact, if you have accents, it would have unicode escape sequences.
And if it was created with a name and then renamed, it might keep the 
old name, I don't recall exactly.

Sorry, this script was quickly written when I used to take my 
webserver with me during half-boring classes.

>Or am I

You found a problem with the script editor. It doesn't give much 
information about the exceptions.
I thought, let's fix that. So I opened the editor project. I then 
thought, ok, let's start with the fact that it doesn't cover the full 
screen. I fixed that. (you can find it on the npds website, it's 
script editor 2.01). And then I realized that showing more 
information was in fact the matter of the core. So I've updated 
nHTTPd to 2.046 as well.

Please note that if you put a wrong symbol in there, there shouldn't 
be any exception. If you update and try evaluate, we'll know more 
about your issue.

Well, it looks like the problem wasn't your script, but my translation of 
your French variable and array names into something more English. I 
obviously mistyped something because your original script works fine.

>You found a problem with the script editor. It doesn't give much 
>information about the exceptions.

Well, I do get them now. And the error was a -48401 (expected an array). 
This pointed me to the fact that my translated array names weren't as 
exact as they should have been.

The only other thing that's a problem with the script editor is that you 
can't scroll down all the way to the end of long scripts (like the recent 
post script). I have to copy and paste the script between notes in order 
to properly edit it. Having a select all button would be useful too. Or 
else being able to reference a script that exists in a note.

Anyway, things are working now and I can go ahead a customize the script 
a bit.

Thanks Paul.

As I left home after lunch today, the cable guy was out messing with a

line for my neighbours next door, and while they were at it were going to 
replace the line to my house as well.  (Thanks for the notice!)  As a

I know that this list isn't a training course for newbie NewtScript

I'm working on trying to learn NewtScript (I'm far behind Grant). As my
first project I've taken on adding a version number for the package listing
script.
 
If any of you could go to my "Node 2" NPDS server and click on the Installed
Packages" link you'll see the error that I get.
 
Does anyone know what this error means?

That really doesn't tell you anything.  (Actually, it just tells you that 
the NewtonScript compiler couldn't compile it.  Duh.)

Post the script and then we can have a go at it.

Oh, if you only knew how little I actually know about NewtonScript...

I was actually trying to do the same thing last, but keep running into a 
problem where the script didn't know how to handle the version data. IIRC 
it had something to do with integer variables trying to access array 
elements. I'll see if I can dig up my version of the script too.

The source is where its been for quite a while now... on the site the 
Paul, Victor, and Adam Tow set up:

     http://npds.free.fr/

As for the old Lightyear site, here is what Matt Vaughn had to say about 
it disappearing back in September:

Eventually, all of the original content from Matt's NPDS site will be 
hosted on npds.free.fr - it's just a matter of time for Matt to get 
things moved over.

Whether it is the id or the pssid, this id depends on the store on 
your Newton. I even think that if you do a backup/restore cycle, this 
ID will change.
The creation date or compression rate would be more interesting ;)

Of course, you're right again. :)

I decided to get rid of the version number (which is fairly useless) and 
the id number (which, as you mentioned will change) and added the 
creation date instead. One thing I have noticed with the creation date, 
is that certain packages (specifically backdrops with the 'drds' 
copyright string) have a 6 digit value in the creation date frame. All of 
the other packages use an 8 digit value. You'll notice that the creation 
dates for those packages all say that they were created in the year 2005 
(or is that 1905?). Is there an easy way to pick out these shorter values 
and convert them using DateNTime() differently?

Another observation: Some of the copyright strings use high-ASCII 
characters, but they do not appear correctly on the page served up in 
NPDS.

For example: '©1998 Softwarebüro Müller. All rights reserved.'

Appears as:  '©1998 Softwarebro Mller. All rights reserved.'

Is there a simple function that will escape these characters in the 
string prior to writing them out as html?

Thanks again for your help Paul.

From: Matt Vaughn <nospam_matt.vaughn_at_mindspring_dot_com>

Grant (and all others interested in using those funny high-ASCII 
characters with NPDS),

This is happening because the newton character set is Unicode while the 
standard for the web is ISO-8859-1. Try using a soup editor to change 
the 'mime' slot of the NPDS preferences frame from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 
or UTF-7 and see if that helps.

Explanation: When NPDS was first developed, IE 4 was the most advanced 
browser and had only basic unicode support. Netscape 4.7 was a train 
wreck, by comparison. I set the encoding to ISO-8859-1 because for the 
most part, it worked to display high ASCII characters. One thing I was 
planning on was developing a translator that would convert Unicode 
characters to their HTML-escaped forms but that approach, I believe, is 
obsolete. Now that we have HTML 4.0-compliant browsers such as Mozilla, 
Netscape 7, Chimera, Opera, and various IE flavors, you should be able 
to view Newton's Unicode characters by altering the encoding in the 
HTTP header. Updating the mime slot will (or should at least) do that.

Actually, NPDS uses NIE string transfer. NIE converts Unicode to 
MacRoman. Tell NPDS to do MacRoman (this is in the preferences). It 
will only fail with NetHopper. It's what I do on my own Newton, so 
dates in French appear properly.

I think they're books, aren't they? So I first thought it was the 
date the user put in NewtonPress. But it may instead be some kind of 
bug in NewtonPress or that we don't interpret this properly. I don't 
know any other Newton format that would give us 6 digits dates.

There are many formats of dates, but only two are usable in NewtonScript:
seconds since 1993 or something like this
minutes since 1904

Other formats are internal (because they span on more than 28 bits).

>Is there an easy way to pick out these shorter values

I don't know what these values actually mean. I'll try to look at 
what GNUE's package info says about these packages.

If you write éèçà in a Note, you'll get that problem as well. Set the 
encoding to x-mac-roman, either in NPDS or in your package page.

My pleasure. Will you share the full script with us?

What? I had no idea NIE did that conversion! That explains a lot of 
issues I encountered. I suppose a good reading of the NIE docs would 
have helped me in this respect but it never occurred to me that the 
network layer would alter the stream of data being sent. In a perfect 
world, I guess one would call this a design flaw, but if you consider 
that Unicode was NOT a widely accepted standard on the Internet as 
recently as 2.5 years ago, it's actually a nice bit of Apple genius to 
have included that functionality.

Regarding x-mac-roman encoding, do you find that this approach works 
with Windows and X-windows based browsers? If not, then the proper 
thing to do would be to try to force NIE to NOT do the conversion, send 
raw unicode characters, and set the encoding to UTF-8. The end result 
SHOULD be perfect character display of even non-Roman fonts (such as 
Cyrillic, Big5 Chinese, Japanese, and so on).

It must be a bug. At first I though it may have been the format I used to 
enter the date in the books I created, but then I recalled that 
NewtonPress wouldn't allow different formatting in the field other than 
what was specified in the manual (MMM, DD YYYY). Likewise, books created 
by other folks seem to have the same issue.

I forgot that I could globally set the encoding in NPDS. Thanks for the 
tip. The characters display fine in Mac IE 5.x, NS 6.x, NS 7.x, Mozilla, 
and NS 4.x (although the CSS is completely fux0rd in NS 4 anyway...) 
Window IE 5 under Win98 doesn't handle the new encoding properly, neither 
does IE 6 under WinXP. I was reading a bit on UTF encoding, and switching 
to it could cause even more issues with folks browsing on platforms that 
do not support Unicode at the OS-level. In fact, setting the NPDS to 
UTF-7 or UTF-8 makes no difference in IE 6. In fact, the character 
display as undefined boxes. Yikes.

See, this is why I'd like to convert the high-ASCII characters to 
entities on the fly... what a mess. I think I'll stick with MacRoman 
encoding so at least things look good for Mac OS users.

>Will you share the full script with us?

Indeed. I'll post it in a separate message.

Actually, you have to recall that NIE uses NewtonOS communication 
layer which was fundamentally designed to hook a Newton to a Mac.

Matt, NewtonOS doesn't do UTF-8. It does UCS-2 (today replaced by 
UTF-16) which is 16 bits per character. You need to transform the 
data back and forth to 8 bits per character with UTF-8.

We can't force NIE to not do the conversion. If we could anyway, we 
give NIE Unicode 16 bits strings and the client expects 8 bits 
strings. If NIE just truncates the words and keep the lower byte, we 
get ISO-8859-1.

SimpleMail transfers data as an array of integers to avoid NIE's conversion.
NewtsCape does the same for other reasons when the data's size isn't known.

Anyway, NIE has a lot of design flaws because of the bad use of the 
communication layer. The best would be to replace that by native 
calls. With native calls, you don't have conversion at all. So you 
can take the unicode data, look if it is pure ISO-8859-1 or not, if 
it's not convert it to UTF-8 and send it to the client.

This is called NPDS 3.x.

Subject: [NPDS] nHTML 1.2 beta 1 -- 12/5/2002
From: Adam Tow <nospam_adam_at_tow_dot_com>

Everyone:

I've been experimenting again with NPDS now that I've finally got my 
Ethernet and wireless cards working on my Newtons. Since I do quite a 
bit of web design these days, I thought that I'd revisit nHTML. I took 
a version that was slightly modified by Ken Hagler and updated it this 
evening.

=====================
What's New or Changed
=====================
1) Smaller screen real-estate used. If you edit HTML in landscape mode, 
you can "replace" the Button Bar with nHTML by moving it over the 
Button Bar. nHTML will fit exactly over the Button Bar, allowing you to 
see the entire screen when in Notes or Works.

2) Added preference to close singular tags with the " />". This is good 
if you're coding to any of the XHTML document types.

3) Added DocumentType button. Choose from XHTML 1.1, XHTML 1.0 
Transitional, XHTML 1.0 Frameset, XHTML 1.0 Strict, HTML 4.01 
Transitional, HTML 4.01 Frameset, HTML 4.01 Strict, HTML 3.2, or 
Compact HTML 2.0.

4) Removed the "http://" from the base element input line in the 
Document slip.

5) Tags are now in lowercase.

6) Added <div> and <span> buttons.

7) Added class, id, and style elements for <p>, <div>, <span>.

8) Added NPDS picker to input special tags like <pager>, <note_list>, 
<calendar>, etc.

9) Cleaned up the toolbar, removing features that never worked (i.e. 
FTP, Convert to HTML), or that people shouldn't be using anymore (i.e. 
<blink>).

10) Added id element to <img> tag.

11) nHTML no longer minimizes when you open a dialog. Now that the app 
is much smaller, it didn't make sense anymore to constantly be 
minimizing and expanding.

12) Other minor fixes and additions.

==========
Next Steps
==========
I'm planning on revising the List, Table, Form, and Style forms next, 
making them inline with most of the functionality of the HTML Palette 
in BBEdit 7.01.

I'm also planning on making it possible to add your own tags to the 
list (i.e. changed the Entity popup to Custom). This way, you can 
extend the functionality of nHTML without having to update the 
application itself.

========
Download
========
Here's the non-public page for the application. I'll make it live when 
the software is released to the public, but you can download it now to 
test it out.

	http://www.tow.com/software/nhtml/

Let me know what you think of the new version or if you have 
suggestions on making the application better! Thanks and enjoy!

This rocks. You've implemented all of the changes I had been gradually 
adding to my version of the nHTML source, as well as a whole pile of 
other standards-compliant loveliness. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I start playing with it and let you know if there are any glitches.

Hey Matt.

Would you be able to change the redirect on your 
http://come.to/lightyear_media account to point to the npds.free.fr 
server for the time being? It would be great if we could have all those 
footer links in NPDS point to the development site instead of the defunct 
homepage.mac.com page for the time being.

Just wondering.

Grant,

I had forgotten about that link in all the NPDS-generated pages. 
However, it's taken care of now -- the changes should manifest within a 
few hours. Let me know if there are further problems with it. In fact, 
I could transfer ownership of that redirect to someone more involved in 
NPDS development.

Matt

I'd be more than happy to handle that for now. I'm going to be updating 
the NPDS dev site (cleaning out the dead links and mirroring some related 
information) and doing general maintenance. Paul gave me the keys to the 
car this week...

Awesome.  Please re-write the awful page I made - about the only thing it's got going for it is that it's valid HTML 2.0 :)  I wrote it in an hour at work this summer....

And it's a lovely, functional page. Other than a bit of sprucing up and 
cleaning out the dead links, I'm probably not going to do too much to it 
for a few weeks yet.

Well... maybe a bit of XHTML and CSS sprinkled here and there.

Subject: [NPDS] How-to for adding binaries to "Binaries@Binary Server" store?
From: John Skinner <nospam_john_at_johnskinner_dot_net>

 Hey,
 
 A while back I had messed with this and figured it all out. Now I've lost
all 
 my old email messages back and forth with Paul Guyot about this. I had even
 created a little "cheat sheet" on how to do this (lost also).
 
 Does anyone have notes on how to add another binary to the "Binaries@Binary
 Server" store?
 
 If not, anyone willing to type one up?
 
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I was once writing a program to automate transferring things to the Binaries soup via Sloup.  I'll dig it up this weekend..

Wow! That would be a great tool Victor!

Might even be able to tweak the packages to save it's binary to the "Binary
Server" store!

Once we document processes and NPDS tips like this, I want to make sure 
we post them to the NPDS dev site. This way we can start maintaining a 
repository of help files and tutorials supporting the fruits of out 
labor. Of course, all the documentation will change once NPDS 3.0 comes 
out... ;)

Yeah, but it would give a good history for anyone else to be able to read.

P.S. Is there already a NPDS dev site that has help files (other that the
temp defunct Lightyear site)?

Nope. Not that I know of. However, I'm going to start moving all of 
Matt's old documentation over to npds.free.fr for the time being. Stay 
tuned for some groovy dev site updates.

Before you get your hopes up, let me state that I wrote it in Visual Basic, so this ain't gonna be running on a Mac anytime soon.  And serial-only, of course.  But IIRC it did work on most small files.  Automatically set the MIME type slot in its entry and everything.

If it does what you say, then that is awesome! It doesn't matter to me
whether it is on Mac, PC or Linux. I have all those and it would beat
copying and pasting by hand all that hex code!

P.S. Did it not work on large files (what do you consider small)?

Great! I've been following the dialogs between you and Matt about a home for
the old lightyear site. I miss being able to do my regular browsing of the
NPDS manual!

NPDS binary server currently sends the whole binary to the network at 
once. So if you have a too large binary, it will fail anyway.

John, I probably have the messages we exchanged if Victor doesn't 
find his tool. Grant, I also have the archives of the NPDS mailing 
list.
