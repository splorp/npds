<H1>Introducing.. NewtonOS Personal Data Sharing</H1>

<H2><A NAME=What></A>What is NewtonOS Personal Data Sharing?</H2>

<P>NPDS is as much a concept as anything else. When the Newton was
conceived and then sold a fundamental tenet of its design was its
portability. Yet, never during the course of its short and brilliant
lifetime was it actually PORTABLE.

<BLOCKQUOTE>You could connect to any desktop.. as long as NCU or NBU
   or Xport was installed.
   
   <P>You could print out information.. if you had a compatible
   printer.
   
   <P>You could let others see your schedule.. if they had a fax to
   send it to.. or a Newton of their own.
   
   <P><I>Etcetera, Ad Nauseum, Ad infinitum...</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/npdslogo.jpg" ALT="NPDS Logo" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=right>NPDS
was designed to address some of these shortcomings and also as a
proof of concept that PDAs should have HTTP servers embedded in them
as a means of communicating with the outside world.

<P>So, to answer the original question:
"<FONT COLOR="#99FF99"><I>What is Newton Personal Data
Sharing?</I></FONT>"

<P>NewtonOS Personal Data Sharing is a suite of software for the
Newton that allows you to transparently share Notes, Calendar
Entries, and Cardfile entries with clients on the WWW. It's a
<B>battery powered webserver</B> that sports features often reserved
for "big iron" servers.. <I>scriptability, security, dymamic content
generation, instant messenging</I>, etc..

<H2><A NAME=Why></A>Why Do I Want To Use It?</H2>
