<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A NAME=Revamp></A>Seriously Revamping your
NPDS Layout</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Cascading Style Sheet Implementation I
implemented in NPDS 2.0 was designed primarily as away to enforce the
layout of NPDS HTML without generating and transmitting gross amounts
of formatting data. For instance, according to HTML 3.2 specs, to
apply font choice to a document, one must apply it to every "Block
element" separately. That means every P, TR, LI, etc has to have a
separate FONT wrapper. That can add up to a HUGE amount of
non-informative data to your page that slows down generation,
transmission, and rendering. To further exacerbate things, the
rendering of HTML formatted in this manner is very inconsistent
between browsers and platforms.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Contrast the HTML 3.2 formatting approach to
that defined in HTML 4.0 + Cascading Style Sheets. Under HTML 4.0,
one declares all instances of a given tag's formatting before the
document is rendered. Better yet, subclasses of each element can be
defined with different properties from the parent. In NPDS, I defined
a sub-class "HILITE" of TD (Table Cell) that is defined as having a
highlighted background color. To make a TD element "light up", I
define it as &lt;TD CLASS=HILITE&gt; instead of &lt;TD&gt; within the
HTML.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The LI (list item) element also has NPDS
specific subclasses which are "CHECKED" and "UNCHECKED" since I use
lists as the HTML markup for outlines and To-Do lists. In one of my
style sheets, I set the UNCHECKED class to have a highlighted
background and be rendered in bold text. It looked cool. In general,
I have the checked items set to normal font and the unchecked items
set to bold. It provides a nice visual delineation between the two
kinds of list item.</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A NAME=Import></A>Importing your CSS from
"Elsewhere"</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">While there's quite an advantage to sending
all the style data at the beginning of the document, we're still
making NPDS do more work than is 100% required. The common way of
using style sheets is to reference a single style sheet file from
several HTML files by using a forward link to import the Style sheet.
Since my standard NPDS Style Sheet is about 500 bytes, this means we
could save that 500 bytes every page we served by storing the NPDS
Style sheet somewhere else and referencing it. Actually, using a
remote style sheet would allow you to custominze the look of your
Newton server by changing the REMOTE FILE! So, with all these
advantages spelled out, let's get to work on this.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">On the UNIX account I use to administer
Lightyear Media, I have stored a style sheet file named
"lym_book.css" that I want to use to format my Newton server pages.
To use this file, I'll open the CSS Editor and change the Style Sheet
from a full CSS file wrapped by STYLE tags to the following:</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000066"><CODE>&lt;LINK REL=stylesheet
HREF="http://pop.life.uiuc.edu/~mwvaugh/lightyear/lym_book.css"
TYPE="text/css"&gt;</CODE></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Now, when a NPDS page is served, the browser
will be directed to look for the style sheet on my MUCH faster
Solaris machine!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You can |<B> </B></FONT><A HREF="http://pop.life.uiuc.edu/~mwvaugh/lightyear/lym_book.css" TARGET="_blank"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><B>click
here</B></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"> | to access this CSS file to
see a real Style Sheet. Feel free to modify it or use it verbatim.
Keep in mind that this is my actual current style sheet and may
change frequently!</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana"><A NAME=Misc></A>Color-HexCode
Table</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">We all want really cool looking Newtons,
right? And the drab olive color I shipped as the highlight color in
NPDS 2.02 is the pits, too, ain't it? Well, never fear.. I have found
a small series of tables that present the 216 color Web-Safe Palette
of colors along with their respective Hex codes. Hopefully, these
will help you overcome the lack of a color picker on the Newton for
choosing your Layout colors and lead to some snazzy-looking Newton
sites. Usually, what's nice to do is keep the same level of
brightness but vary the hue around 1/6 to 1/4 of the color wheel.
Just fool around with it, eh? I am currently running a light salmon
background with steel grey highlights. It looks really subdued but I
like it since I keep my Newton open to my weekly overview in a
browser on my desk.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Since it's a goodly amount of HTML, the page
containing this color guide is </FONT><A HREF="colortab.html"><FONT FACE="Verdana">here.</FONT></A>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana">A Most Generous Offer...</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You folks are really golden and I happen to
think that linking to a remote style sheet is cool. So, if you create
a neat-o style sheet using whatever method you choose, I'll host it
on my server for you to reference from your Newton. I can give you
one or two updates of it a month. What I'll need, if you want to do
this, is an email containing the .css file </FONT><A HREF="mailto:LightyearDesign@mac.com"><FONT FACE="Verdana">sent
to me</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"> along with your name and any
other info I might need.</FONT>
