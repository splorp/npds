<H1>Using Notepad Server</H1>

<H2><IMG SRC="../images/shots/noteserv.gif" WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=76 ALIGN=right><B>Introduction:</B></H2>

<P>NoteServ is simple extension with a lot of power behind it. Any
note you write and file in a specially selected folder will be made
available on the WWW when nHTTPd is active. These Notes can be

<UL>
   <LI>regular old <B>plaintext notes</B></LI>
   
   <LI><B>checklists</B>,</LI>
   
   <LI>or <B>outllines</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>and NoteServ will dish them up just the same, turning them from
Notes to Web pages behind the scenes. You don't have to do a thing!

<P>You're not limited to boring old notes, either. You can also serve
up fancy hybrid HTML/text notes, straight HTML notes, or run CGI
scripts from within your Notes. Information on how to do these tasks
is in the <A HREF="advanced.html">"Advanced" Chapter</A>.

<P>However, let me STRESS once again that you don't need to mess with
the advanced stuff at all to make NoteServ and NPDS work for YOU.
It's designed to be simple for the casual user but powerful for the
super-user.

<P>We've established that making Notes available to WWW visitors is
as simple as writing down some text in a Note and filing that Note in
the folder you have selected to be your WWW directory. There's no
length limit on these notes other than the length imposed by the
Newton Operating System.

<P>Let's discuss some special features of <B>NoteServ</B> you can use
to GREATLY enhance the content of your served Notes that don't
require any work on your part.

<H2>Posting Notes Via A Web Browser</H2>

<P>NoteServ contains two services for submitting notes remotely via a
WWW browser. Users can post to the directory designated as the WWW
service directory. These are special notes and will be designated via
an internal mechanism as being client posted. You, the administrator,
can post notes using a separate service. You can post to any folder
on your Newton (allowing you to send data to your Newt that's NOT
available on the Web). You'll need to know your admin password and be
able to limit your Notes to around 2048 bytes but other than that
you're set. So how do these work?

<H3>Client Posting</H3>

<P>If you point the browser to
<FONT COLOR="#0033FF"><U>http://your.newton.com/html/postnote.html
</U></FONT>you'll get the Whiteboard for Public Users screen which
contains a form for submitting Name, Title, and Note Text. One can
easily embed this URL with the text "Whiteboard" by inserting the
Server Side Include &lt;NOTE_POST&gt; where you want a link to the
Public Whiteboard.

<H3>Admin Posting</H3>

<P>There is no SSI for this path (though you could write one..). To
get to it, point to
<FONT COLOR="#0033FF"><U>/html/admin-post.html</U></FONT> Once there,
enter the title and text of the note, choose a folder, and enter your
admin password. Your note will be posted into that folder. 

<H2>LiveLinks:</H2>

<P>Within note, any properly formatted URL will automatically be
turned into a <I>clickable link.</I> For example, if you write
<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>http://www.apple.com/</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
</FONT>in a Note, it will be displayed on the client's web browser as
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">http://www.apple.com/</A> The same is
true for <FONT COLOR="#0033CC">gopher,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#0033CC">ftp, mailto:</FONT>, and even
<FONT COLOR="#0033CC">hotline</FONT> addresses. This is great for
making lists of hyperlinks, etc for later viewing or sharing.

<H2>Appearance Options:</H2>

<P>You can apply preferences to the way NPDS formats your Notes. In
the Appearance Panel of <B>NPDS Setup</B> program, you'll find
several variables that you can set. You can specify

<UL>
   <LI>default font face,</LI>
   
   <LI>font size,</LI>
   
   <LI>background color</LI>
   
   <LI>"highlight color"</LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition, to facilitate display of non-American ASCII
characters you may wish to specify a MIME character set.

<H2>Variables:</H2>

<P>Quickly,<B> NoteServ</B> supports a range of special variables
called <I>Server Side Includes.</I> Basically, they're stand-ins for
common things like your Name, City, etc as well as for specialized
functions like a Search Form for your Notepad that are replaced an
instant before a page containing them is sent to a WWW Client. We'll
talk about these in later sections of the Manual but I thought I'd
introduce them to you early on since they are a core NPDS concept.
