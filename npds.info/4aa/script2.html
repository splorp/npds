<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A second use of Server Side Includes is to
return values that cannot be determined when you write the page.
Because the Simple Scripting Architecture gives you full access to
the internals of the Newton Operating System, you can do any number
of awesome things. In this chapter, I'll walk through a script that
can return the free heap value. You can follow the RAM status of your
server as well as show off to those guys with 128M of RAM and buggy
servers that you can run a good ship in under 300K of RAM!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">We'll walk through this simpler example first
and then in later chapters, we'll do some other stuff with the Newton
Operating System.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You'll note that for the next couple
sections, I'll reference various Newton Programming documents and
books. This is to get you familiar with looking things up in these
resources if you're not already. I have provided a link to them for
you to </FONT><A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/~mwvaugh/pdf/" TARGET="_blank"><FONT FACE="Verdana">download
them to your hard drive</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"> for your
personal reference.</FONT>

<H2><FONT FACE="Verdana">Background</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Before we write, we need to assemble the
requisite Newtonscript commands to do what we need. In the Newton
Programmer's Reference, we find that all you have to do to see the
heap value is invoke the Stats()</FONT><A HREF="#1"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">
method. They suggest doing a Garbage Collection with
GC()</FONT><A HREF="#2"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">
before polling the heap value to ensure that all the cobwebs are
blown out of memory before trying to assay how much is free.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">I can tell you that Stats() returns a number
but since Newotnscript is good at coercing values depending on what
you are doing with them, we'll just treat it like it was a string in
our script.&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Form here on out, I am going to give you the
Newtonscript code at once. The narrative will be in the //comment
lines. If there are concepts that we just can't deal with in the
comments, we'll get to them at the end of the script.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Heap, of course, will change all the
time. You can also use this kind of script to just pull values out of
the operating system or the Owner information or whatever else. For
instance, this script will return the Fax number of the current Owner
of your Newton. Since I didn't include a Fax SSI, this might come in
handy.</FONT>
