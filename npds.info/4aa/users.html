         <P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Brent sure loves his Newton(s). He's
         fluent in Chinese so he has Chinese input and display on his
         MP2100 (which, by the way, he took to China with him
         recently). He's super-active in student government at

         Newton server</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana"> to keep people
         posted on his comings and goings as well as any news he
         wants to put up. Brent's system has been a testbed for many,
         many versions of NPDS 2.0x and has contributed a huge number
         of great ideas to the NPDS effort so if you get a chance,
         drop by his 'pad and thank him for his work and Newton
         evangelism.</FONT>

         Austria. He's provided a lot of ideas for NPDS during its
         development cycle and he's a rabid Newton enthusiast. From
         my correspondences with Peter, I have gained new momentum in
         NPDS' development since he pointed out how well Newtscape
         and NPDS could work together. Thanks Peter!</FONT>
