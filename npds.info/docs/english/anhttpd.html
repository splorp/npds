<H2><A NAME=Cache></A>The Cache Manager:</H2>

<P>Although still in its developmental stages, the NPDS Cache manager
(available from nHTTPd's Info Button as well as anywhere you see a
spyglass icon) allows you to browse the NPDS cache to see what's in
there and delete things you think should be gone.

<P>Before you randomly delete, know that nHTTPd<I> already
</I>manages the cache by deleting expired entries every time it shuts
down.

<P>The Cache Manager is fairly simple in function now. The name of
the entry, its creator, date of creation, and any miscellaneous
developer included data is displayed on the left and a preview is
displayed on the right.

<P>You can move forward and back through the cache using the arrows
and delete entries using the trash button. Close the Cache Browser by
tapping its close box.

         <P>This number represents milliseconds of latency after
         commencing transmission of TCP/IP data before the connection
         is destroyed. If you have a fast machine and a good
         connection you can likely set this to around 500.
         
         <P>If you start getting a lot of partial pages sent, bump it

<P>Connect to your server's <FONT COLOR="#0033CC">/cfg/

presented two options:

<OL>
   <LI><B>NPDS Log</B></LI>
   
   <LI><B>NPDS Shutdown</B></LI>
</OL>

<P>Invoke either function by entering the current Administrator
password in the <B>Password</B> text field and hitting 'Return'.

<P><A NAME=Log></A><B>NPDS Log </B>will take entries logged according
to your Logging preferences and generate a tab-delimited log file.
Currently, only sorting by <B>host</B> is supported though other
sortings are planned.

<P><A NAME=Kill></A><B>NPDS Shutdown</B> will shut down your NPDS
server from the remote location your accessing from, whether it be
your desktop computer or a terminal halfway across the state. No
option for restarting at a future time is planned so <I>be sure</I>
you want to shut NPDS down when you do so!
