Caveats</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">With the official release of NPDS 2.0x, I
have released it under the GNU public license (despite the fact that
I am aghast at how the founder of the free software movement is
acting these days). While a condition of GPL is full public
disclosure, support for the source is more forthcoming for users who
have somehow demonstrated an affinity for NPDS. Being registered
users, you are definitely among this group of great guys and
gals.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><I>A warning to professional
programmers: do not laugh at my source code or I'll sic my cats on
you. I taught myself to program the Newton from the ground up. I
don't know C. I never learned Pascal. To you, NPDS may look ugly,
bizarre, or inefficient inside. Hold your nose,dive in, and fix
it.</I></FONT>

<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana">File Formats</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">For the near-term, the NPDS source is
released as a series of Macintosh Newton Toolkit projects. A WinNTK
version of these files may be created with major source code releases
after this one if it's not too terribly difficult. Text file versions
of each project are also available.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The source to NPDS is covered under Gnu
Public License even though I can't believe how Richard Stallman is
acting these days (April 1999). The most current version of NPDS
Source will be available at the following address:</FONT>
